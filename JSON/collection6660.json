A generalizable and simple survival calculator based on data from US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has not yet been introduced. Objective: Develop and validate a clinical tool to predict 7-day survival in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective and prospective cohort study. Setting: Thirteen acute care hospitals in the New York City area. Participants: Adult patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The development and internal validation cohort included patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 6, 2020. The external validation cohort included patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 5, 2020. Measurements: Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and outcome data were extracted from the electronic health record. Optimal predictors and performance were identified using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with receiver operating characteristic curves and measurements of area under the curve (AUC). Results: The development and internal validation cohort included 11 095 patients with a median age of 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 54-77]. Overall 7-day survival was 89%. Serum blood urea nitrogen, age, absolute neutrophil count, red cell distribution width, oxygen saturation, and serum sodium were identified as the 6 optimal of 42 possible predictors of survival. These factors constitute the NOCOS (Northwell COVID-19 Survival) Calculator. Performance in the internal validation, prospective validation, and external validation were marked by AUCs of 0.86, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively. Limitations: All participants were hospitalized within the New York City area. Conclusions: The NOCOS Calculator uses 6 factors routinely available at hospital admission to predict 7-day survival for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The calculator is publicly available at https:\/\/feinstein.northwell.edu\/NOCOS.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Todd J.

In this study, we conduct a secondary analysis of COVID-19 case growth data to compare the differences in the effectiveness of NPIs among 16 representative countries in the world. Methods: This study leverages publicly available data to learn patterns of dynamic changes in the reproduction rate for sixteen countries covering Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. Furthermore, we model the relationships between the cumulative number of cases and the dynamic reproduction rate to characterize the effectiveness of the NPIs. We learn four levels of NPIs according to their effects in the control of COVID-19 growth and categorize the 16 countries into the corresponding groups. Results: The dynamic changes of the reproduction rate are learned via linear regression models for all of the studied countries, with the average adjusted R-squared at 0.96 and the 95% confidence interval as [0.94 0.98]. China, South Korea, Argentina, and Australia are at the first level of NPIs, which are the most effective. Japan and Egypt are at the second level of NPIs, and Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Spain, are at the third level. The US and UK have the most inefficient NPIs, and they are at the fourth level of NPIs. Conclusions: COVID-19 case growth data provides evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NPIs. Understanding the differences in the efficacy of the NPIs among countries in the world can give guidance for emergent public health events.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"You Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yubo Feng","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Chao Yan","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Xinmeng Zhang","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Gao","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lance B.

Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM\/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM\/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the 139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22\/38) and 68.4% (26\/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55\/74) and 82.4% (61\/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kazuo Imai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Tabata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayu Ikeda","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sakiko Noguchi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Kitagawa","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Masaru Matuoka","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Norihito Tarumoto","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Sakai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shigefumi Maesaki","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076281","rel_title":"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076281","rel_abs":"Introduction: As of early December 2019, COVID-19, a disease induced by SARS-COV-2, has started spreading, originated in Wuhan, China, and now on, have infected more than 2 million individuals throughout the world. Purpose: This study aimed to nowcast the COVID-19 outbreak throughout Iran and to forecast the trends of the disease spreading in the upcoming month. Methods: The cumulative incidence and fatality data were extracted from official reports of the National Ministry of Health and Medical Educations of Iran. To formulate the outbreak dynamics, six phenomenological models, as well as a modified mechanistic Susciptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, were implemented. The models were calibrated with the integrated data, and trends of the epidemic in Iran was then forecasted for the next month. Results: The final outbreak size calculated by the best fitted phenomenological models was estimated to be in the range of 68,486 to 118,923 cases; however, the calibrated SEIR model estimated that the outbreak would rage again, starting from April 26. Moreover, projected by the mechanistic model, approximately half of the infections have undergone undetected. Conclusion: Although the advanced phenomenological models perfectly fitted the data, they are incapable of applying behavioral aspects of the outbreak and hence, are not reliable enough for authorities' decision adoptions. In contrast, the mechanistic SEIR model alarms that the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran may peak for the second time, consequent to lifting the control measures. This implies that the government may implement a more granular decision making to control the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamidreza Masjedi","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Bahranizadd","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hosein Zare","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Yutaro Kitagawa","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Masaru Matuoka","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kazuyasu Miyoshi","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Norihito Tarumoto","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Sakai","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shigefumi Maesaki","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Maeda","author_inst":"Saitama Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20075796","rel_title":"COVID-19 serial interval estimates based on confirmed cases in public reports from 86 Chinese cities","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20075796","rel_abs":"As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread widely and claim lives worldwide, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain.

For U.S. states, weather variables show opposite effects when compared to the case of countries: higher temperature or absolute humidity imply faster early outbreak. The higher the population density or the earlier the date when state reached 100th case, the faster the pace of outbreak. When all variables are considered, only population density and the timeline variable show statistical significance. Discounting the effect of the timeline variable, we obtain an estimate for the initial growth rate of Covid-19, which can be also used to estimate the basic reproduction number for a region, in terms of population density. This has policy implications regarding how to control the pace of Covid-10 outbreak in a particular area, and we discuss some of them. In the case of countries, for which we did not have demographic information, weather variables lose statistical significance once the timeline variable is added. Relaxing CI requirements, absolute humidity contributes mildly to the reduction of growth rate of cases for the countries studied. Our results suggest that population density should be employed as a control variable and that analysis should have a local character, for subregions and countries separately, in studies involving the dynamics of Covid-19 and similar infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renato H.L.

DESIGN Retrospective, observational case series. SETTING Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital PARTICIPANTS Thirty-three patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to hospital. Data were collected from January 27 to April 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Throat swabs, sputum, stool, and blood samples were collected, and viral load was measured by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Specific IgM and IgG against spike protein (S), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) were analyzed. RESULTS At the early stages of symptom onset, SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in throat swabs and sputum, but lower in stool. The median (IQR) time of undetectable viral RNA in throat swab, sputum, and stool was 18.5 (13.25-22) days, 22 (18.5-27.5) days, and 17 (11.5-32) days, respectively. In sputum, 17 patients (51.5%) had undetectable viral RNA within 22 days (short persistence), and 16 (48.5%) had persistent viral RNA more than 22 days (long persistence). Three patients (9.1%) had a detectable relapse of viral RNA in sputum within two weeks of their discharge from the hospital. One patient had persistent viral RNA for 59 days or longer. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgM, anti-RBD IgM, and anti-N IgM was 10.5 (7.75-15.5) days, 14 (9-24) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. The median (IQR) seroconversion time of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-N IgG was 10 (7.25-16.5) days, 13 (9-17) days, and 10 (7-14) days, respectively. By week 8 after symptom onset, IgM were negative in many of the previously positive patients, and IgG levels remained less than 50% of the peak levels in more than 20% of the patients. In about 40% of the patients, anti-RBD IgG levels were 4-times higher in convalescence than in acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA coexisted with antibodies for more than 50 days. Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels, including anti-RBD IgM levels at presentation and peak time, were significantly higher in viral RNA short persistence patients than in long persistence patients. CONCLUSION This study adds important new information about the features of viral load and antibody dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It is clear from these results that the viral RNA persists in sputum and stool specimens for a relatively long time in many patients. Anti-RBD may also serve as a potential protective antibody against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as viral persistence appears to be related to anti-RBD levels. Earlier treatment intervention also appears to be a factor in viral persistence.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianping Huang","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University,  Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingting Mao","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shufei Li","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lianpeng Wu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Xu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huanzheng Li","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chenyang xu","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feifei Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou  Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianyi Dai","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jichan Shi","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Cai","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chongquan Huang","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuan Lin","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dong Chen","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou Sixth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Lin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baochang Sun","author_inst":"Wenzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shaohua Tang","author_inst":"Dingli Clinical Medical School of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20076190","rel_title":"Characterization of clinical progression of COVID-19 patients in Shenzhen, China","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20076190","rel_abs":"Background: Understanding clinical progression of COVID-19 is a key public health priority that informs resource allocation during an emergency. We characterized clinical progression of COVID-19 and determined important predictors for faster clinical progression to key clinical events and longer use of medical resources. Methods and Findings: The study is a single-center, observational study with prospectively collected data from all 420 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in Shenzhen between January 11th and March 10th, 2020 regardless of clinical severity. Using competing risk regressions according to the methods of Fine and Gray, we found that males had faster clinical progression than females in the older age group and the difference could not be explained by difference in baseline conditions or smoking history. We estimated the proportion of cases in each severity stage over 80 days following symptom onset using a nonparametric method built upon estimated cumulative incidence of key clinical events. Based on random survival forest models, we stratified cases into risk sets with very different clinical trajectories. Those who progressed to the severe stage (22%,93\/420), developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (9%,39\/420), and were admitted to the intensive care unit (5%,19\/420) progressed on average 9.5 days (95%CI 8.7,10.3), 11.0 days (95%CI 9.7,12.3), and 10.5 days (95%CI 8.2,13.3), respectively, after symptom onset. We estimated that patients who were admitted to ICUs remained there for an average of 34.4 days (95%CI 24.1,43.2). The median length of hospital stay was 21.3 days (95%CI, 20.5,22.2) for cases who did not progress to the severe stage, but increased to 52.1 days (95%CI, 43.3,59.5) for those who required critical care. Conclusions: Our analyses provide insights into clinical progression of cases starting early in the course of infection. Patient characteristics near symptom onset both with and without lab parameters have tremendous potential for predicting clinical progression and informing strategic response.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Chengcheng Hong","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Meng","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Zhenke Wu","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"},{"author_name":"Pengzheng Zhou","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Lauren M Kucirka","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075804","rel_title":"Assessing suppression strategies against epidemic outbreaks like COVID-19: the SPQEIR model","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075804","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 outbreak represents a most serious challenge for societies worldwide. It is endangering the health of millions of people, and resulting in severe socioeconomic challenges due to lock-down measures. Governments worldwide aim to devise exit strategies to revive the economy while keeping the pandemic under control. The problem is that the effects of distinct measures are not well quantified. This paper compares several suppression approaches and potential exit strategies using a new extended epidemic SEIR model. It concludes that while rapid and strong lock-down is an effective pandemic suppression measure, a combination of other strategies such as social distancing, active protection and removal can achieve similar suppression synergistically. This quantitative understanding will support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions. Finally, the paper provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniele Proverbio","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Francoise Kemp","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Stefano Magni","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Andreas Dominik Husch","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Atte Aalto","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Mombaerts","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Alexander Skupin","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jorge Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jose Ameijeiras-Alonso","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ley","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075705","rel_title":"COVID-19: One-month impact of the French lockdown on the epidemic burden","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075705","rel_abs":"On March 16 2020, French authorities ordered a large scale lockdown to counter the COVID-19 epidemic wave rising in the country, stopping non-essential economic, educational, and entertainment activities, maintaining mainly food retailers and healthcare institutions. One month later, the number of new hospitalizations and ICU admissions had reached a plateau and were beginning a slow descent. We developed a spatialized, deterministic, age-structured, and compartmental SARS-CoV-2 transmission model able to reproduce the pre-lockdown dynamic of the epidemic in each of the 13 French metropolitan regions. Thanks to this model, we estimate, at regional and national levels, the total number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, hospital beds requirements (hospitalization and ICU), and hospital deaths which may have been prevented by this massive and unprecedented intervention in France. If no control measures had been set up, between March 19 and April 19 2020, our analysis shows that almost 23% of the French population would have been affected by COVID-19 (14.8 million individuals). Hence, the French lockdown prevented 587,730 hospitalizations and 140,320 ICU admissions at the national level. The total number of ICU beds required to treat patients in critical conditions would have been 104,550, far higher than the maximum French ICU capacity. This first month of lockdown also permitted to avoid 61,739 hospital deaths, corresponding to a 83.5% reduction of the total number of predicted deaths. Our analysis shows that in absence of any control measures, the COVID-19 epidemic would have had a critical morbidity and mortality burden in France, overwhelming in a matter of weeks French hospital capacities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan Roux","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9ment Massonnaud","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449; Rouen University Hospital, Department of Biostatistics"},{"author_name":"Pascal Cr\u00e9pey","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Andreas Dominik Husch","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Atte Aalto","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Mombaerts","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Alexander Skupin","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jorge Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jose Ameijeiras-Alonso","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ley","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076489","rel_title":"Modeling geographical spread of COVID-19 in India using network-based approach","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076489","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic is a global concern, due to its high spreading and alarming fatality rate. Mathematical models can play a decisive role in mitigating the spread and predicting the growth of the epidemic. India is a large country, with a highly variable inter-state mobility, and dynamically varying infection cases in different locations; thus, the existing models, based solely on the aspects of growth rates, or generalized network concepts, may not provide desired predictions. The internal mobility of a country must be considered, for accurate prediction. Herein, we propose a framework for predicting the geographical spread of COVID-19, using reported COVID-19 cases, census migration data, and monthly airline data of passengers. We discover that spreading depends on the spatial distribution of existing cases, human mobility patterns, and administrative decisions. In India, the mobility towards professional sites can surge incoming cases at Maharastra and Karnataka, while migration towards the native places can risk Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. We anticipate that the state Kerala, with one of the highest cases of COVID-19, may not receive significant incoming cases, while Karnataka and Haryana may receive the challenge of high incoming cases, with medium cases so far. Using airline passenger's data, we also estimate the number of potential incoming cases at various airports. The study predicts that the airports located in the region of north India are vulnerable, whereas in northeast India and in some south India are relatively safe. The detailed analysis in this direction will guide policymakers for prior planning of transport, and minimize the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ankush Kumar","author_inst":"IEMN"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9ment Massonnaud","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449; Rouen University Hospital, Department of Biostatistics"},{"author_name":"Pascal Cr\u00e9pey","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Andreas Dominik Husch","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Atte Aalto","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Mombaerts","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Alexander Skupin","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jorge Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jose Ameijeiras-Alonso","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ley","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075986","rel_title":"Association between environmental pollution and prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075986","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently been upgraded to a pandemic by the World Health Organization due to the alarming levels of spread and severity.

Data on environmental pollution in Italy were retrieved from the 2019 annual report of the organization Legambiente (League for the Ambient). The adjusted correlation between the number of days in which environmental pollutants exceeded established limits and the overall number of COVID-19 cases reveals the existence of a highly significant positive association (r=0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.79; p<0.001).

The mutational support refers to the unknown number of sites mutated across all strains and individual samples of the SARS-Cov-2 genome; given the high cost and limited availability of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits, especially in early stages of infections when only a small number of genomic samples ([~] 1000s) are available that do not allow for determining the exact degree of mutations in an RNA virus that comprises roughly 30, 000 nucleotides. Nevertheless, working with small sample sets is required in order to quickly predict the mutation rate of this and other viruses and get an insight into their transformational power. Furthermore, with the small number of samples available, it is hard to estimate the mutational landscape across different age\/gender groups and geographical locations which may be of great importance in assessing different risk categories and factors influencing susceptibility to infection. To this end, we use our state-of-the art polynomial estimator techniques and the Good-Turing estimator to obtain estimates based on only roughly 1, 000 samples per category. Our analysis reveals an interesting finding: the mutational support appears to be statistically more significant in patients which appear to have lower infection rates and handle the exposure with milder symptoms, such as women and people of relatively young age ([&le;] 55).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishal Rana","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Eli Chien","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Jianhao Peng","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Olgica Milenkovic","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Atte Aalto","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Laurent Mombaerts","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Alexander Skupin","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jorge Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Jose Ameijeiras-Alonso","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ley","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Jiancong Chen","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075861","rel_title":"The Potential Impact of Interruptions to HIV Services: A Modelling Case Study for South Africa","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075861","rel_abs":"The numbers of deaths caused by HIV could increase substantially if the COVID-19 epidemic leads to interruptions in the availability of HIV services.

Number of performed COVID-19 tests has a strong correlation with country-specific incidence (p <2x10-16) and mortality rate (p = 5.1x10-8). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.6x10-15 and 7.0x10-4, respectively), country-specific duration of the outbreak (2.6x10-4 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.8x10-4) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed. Country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality (p = 0.17 and 0.036) whereas population density (p = 0.94 and p = 0.75) and latitude (p = 0.61 and 0.059) did not reach significance in our model. Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p = 0.028). We rank countries by COVID-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile. The ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lev Shagam","author_inst":"GIGA, University of Liege"},{"author_name":"Amyn A.

Since proximity data can be collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this for automated contact tracing providing a major gain over a manual implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of voluntary and automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without population-wide participation to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be counterproductive and allow the pandemic to spread unchecked. The simultaneous implementation of various mitigation methods along with automated contact tracing is necessary for reaching an optimal solution to contain the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyunju Kim","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Ayan Paul","author_inst":"DESY, Hamburg & Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin"},{"author_name":"Saad B.

A comparison with some other SI-like models is done. The analysis of the numbers of cured persons for 38 and 46 days shows behaviours similar to the ones of the infected persons.

We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. Methods The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including area-level socioeconomic deprivation and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for: being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. Results Among 428,225 participants in England, 1,474 had been tested and 669 tested positive between 16 March and 13 April 2020. Black, south Asian and white Irish people were more likely to have confirmed infection (RR 4.01 (95%CI 2.92-5.12); RR 2.11 (95%CI 1.43-3.10); and RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.08-2.38) respectively) and were more likely to be hospital cases compared to the White British. While they were more likely to be tested, they were also more likely to test positive. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 2.26 (95%CI 1.76-2.90); and RR 1.91 (95%CI 1.53-2.38) respectively). Conclusions Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, measured baseline health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Carlos Celis-Morales","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frances Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20074948","rel_title":"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Scans","rel_date":"2020-04-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20074948","rel_abs":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deng-Ping Fan","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhou","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Ge-Peng Ji","author_inst":"School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Geng Chen","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Huazhu Fu","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Jianbing Shen","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Ling Shao","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075457","rel_title":"Organising outpatient dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 patients), but are applicable elsewhere. Methods A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19 (80% infected over three months), to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and examined the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans and relaxing the current policy of single COVID-19 patient transport to allow up to four infected patients at a time. Results If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative\/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed (as sessions are cleared of negative\/recovered patients to enable that session to be dedicated to positive patients). Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and in-patients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity (and possibly leading to a need for temporary movement of dialysis equipment). Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60% of drive time. In mixed urban\/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities. Conclusions Discrete-event simulation simulation and Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model provides a useful method for stress-testing inpatient and outpatient clinical systems prior to peak COVID-19 workloads.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Allen","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Amir Bhanji","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonas Willemsen","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Steven Dudfield","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart Logan","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Thomas Monks","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Jianbing Shen","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Ling Shao","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.20073262","rel_title":"The Approved Dose of Ivermectin Alone is not the Ideal Dose for the Treatment of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.20073262","rel_abs":"Introduction: Caly, Druce (1) reported that ivermectin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro for up to 48 h using ivermectin at 5 uM. The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50, 2 uM) was >35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Method: Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 ug\/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Results: Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50, even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with higher exposure in lungs than plasma, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC50 in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0857 uM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.817 uM). Conclusions: The likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro. Re-purposing drugs for use in COVID-19 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of re-purposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Virginia D Schmith","author_inst":"Nuventra Pharma Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Nuventra Pharma Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lauren RL Lohmer","author_inst":"Nuventra Pharma Sciences"},{"author_name":"Steven Dudfield","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart Logan","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Thomas Monks","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Jianbing Shen","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Ling Shao","author_inst":"Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"},{"author_name":"Naveed Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie K Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.20074245","rel_title":"Analysis of Effectiveness of Quarantine Measures in Controlling COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.20074245","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has created an interesting discourse among the people of the world particularly regarding preventive measures of infectious diseases.

Methods: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from local and national government websites and WHO. Data on hospital capacity and utilisation and observed COVID-19 utilisation data from select locations were obtained from publicly available sources and direct contributions of data from select local governments. We develop a mixed effects non-linear regression framework to estimate the trajectory of the cumulative and daily death rate as a function of the implementation of social distancing measures, supported by additional evidence from mobile phone data. An extended mixture model was used in data rich settings to capture asymmetric daily death patterns. Health service needs were forecast using a micro-simulation model that estimates hospital admissions, ICU admissions, length of stay, and ventilator need using available data on clinical practices in COVID-19 patients. We assume that those jurisdictions that have not implemented school closures, non-essential business closures, and stay at home orders will do so within twenty-one days. Findings: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand in the USA from COVID-19 at the estimated peak of the epidemic (the end of the second week of April) is predicted to be 9,079 (95% UI 253-61,937) total beds and 9,356 (3,526-29,714) ICU beds. At the peak of the epidemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 16,545 (8,083-41,991). The corresponding numbers for EEA countries are 120,080 (119,183-121,107), 32,291 (32,157-32,425) and 28,973 (28,868-29,085) at a peak of April 6. The date of peak daily deaths varies from March 30 through May 12 by state in the USA and March 27 through May 4 by country in the EEA. We estimate that through the end of July, there will be 60,308 (34,063-140,381) deaths from COVID-19 in the USA and 143,088 (101,131-253,163) deaths in the EEA. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 0.3 per million between May 4 and June 29 by state in the USA and between May 4 and July 13 by country in the EEA. Timing of the peak need for hospital resource requirements varies considerably across states in the USA and across regions of Europe. Interpretation: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the USA and EEA to manage, especially for ICU care and ventilator use. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasising the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christopher JL Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Zhiwen Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dhananjay Kalbande","author_inst":"Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Sardar Patel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"B.

One of the baffling aspects of this pandemic is the asymmetric increase in cases and case fatality rate (CFR) among countries. We analyze the time series of the infection and fatality numbers and found two interesting aspects. Firstly, the rate of spread in a region is directly connected to the population density of the region where the virus is spreading. For example, the high rate of increase in cases in the United States of America (USA) is related to the high population density of New York City. This is shown by scaling the cumulative number of cases with a measure of the population density of the affected region in countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, and the USA and we see that the curves are coinciding. Secondly, we analyzed the CFR number as a function of the number of days, since the first death, and we found that there are two clear categories among countries: one category with high CFR numbers (around 10%) and the other category with low CFR numbers (2% to 4%). When we analyzed the results, we see that countries with lower CFR numbers more or less tend to have implemented active control measures such as aggressive testing, tracking down possible infections, effective quarantine measures, etc. Moreover, we did not see any convincing correlation between mortality rates and the median age of the population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eldhose Iype","author_inst":"BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus"},{"author_name":"Sadhya Gulati","author_inst":"BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus"},{"author_name":"Zhiwen Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dhananjay Kalbande","author_inst":"Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Sardar Patel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"B.

The programs were successfully tested using data from advanced outbreak trajectories (Italy and Spain). The procedure was applied to data reported by Argentina. The projected total death toll will be 182 (277-182) with a peak of deaths (6(+\/-2)) the 14 of April. The outbreak begins the 9th of March and end completely the 20th of May. However, already on 1st of May, 2 s (95.45%) of the deaths have occurred. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 36412 and 2275. Then, they were to use to process data from several Southern Hemisphere countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Chile, Panama, Australia, Bolivia, Honduras, New Zealand, Paraguay, Guatemala, Venezuela, Uruguay, El Salvador, Jamaica, Haiti, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The trend is to show low number of total deaths compared with other disease outbreaks. A total projected number of deaths between 15148 and 9939 deaths for a total population of ca. 664 M inhabitants. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The calculated number of infected individuals (worst case scenario) is below 2.5 million. This is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (> 45 millions). In most countries the outbreak will end in May or early June. The dynamics of the outbreaks seems to do not saturate the health services (hospital beds) but only Peru, Ecuador and Panama should have not enough ICU beds for grave COVID-19 patients","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"cesar a barbero","author_inst":"IITEMA-UNRC"},{"author_name":"Sadhya Gulati","author_inst":"BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus"},{"author_name":"Zhiwen Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dhananjay Kalbande","author_inst":"Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Sardar Patel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"B.
