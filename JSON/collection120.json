Using epidemiological models calibrated to the current pandemic, we simulate the time course of each clinical trial design for 504 unique combinations of parameters, allowing us to determine which trial design is most effective for a given scenario. A human challenge trial provides maximal net benefits---averting an additional 1.1M infections and 8,000 deaths in the U.S. compared to the next best clinical trial design---if its set-up time is short or the pandemic spreads slowly. In most of the other cases, an adaptive trial provides greater net benefits.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Donald Berry","author_inst":"MD Anderson"},{"author_name":"Scott Berry","author_inst":"Berry Consultants"},{"author_name":"Peter Hale","author_inst":"Vaccine Foundation"},{"author_name":"Leah Isakov","author_inst":"Seqirus"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Kien Wei Siah","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Chi Heem Wong","author_inst":"MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195305","rel_title":"Proteomics identifies a type I IFN, prothrombotic hyperinflammatory circulating COVID-19 neutrophil signature distinct from non-COVID-19 ARDS","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195305","rel_abs":"Understanding the mechanisms by which infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is of significant clinical interest given the mortality associated with severe and critical coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS, but a relative paucity of these cells is observed at post-mortem in lung tissue of patients who succumb to infection with SARS-CoV-2. With emerging evidence of a dysregulated innate immune response in COVID-19, we undertook a functional proteomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS, non-COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID-19, and healthy controls. We observe that expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. In contrast, release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is significantly increased in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I IFN responses is specific to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and linked to metabolic rewiring. Together this work highlights how differential activation of circulating neutrophil populations may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS, identifying processes that are specific to COVID-19 ARDS.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leila Reyes","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Manuel Alejandro Sanchez-Garcia","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tyler Morrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew JM Howden","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Emily R Watts","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Simone Arienti","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Pranvera Sadiku","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Patricia Coelho","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ananda S Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Hope","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah K Clark","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jo Singleton","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Shonna Johnston","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robert Grecian","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Azin Poon","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah McNamara","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Isla Harper","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Max Head Fourman","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alejandro J Brenes","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pathak","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Amy Lloyd","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Gio Rodriguez Blanco","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alex Von Kriegsheim","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Bart Ghesquiere","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Wesley Vermaelen","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Camila T Cologna","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nik Hirani","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Dockrell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Moira KB Whyte","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David M Griffith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Doreen A Cantrell","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Walmsley","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.20182915","rel_title":"COVID-19 epidemic modelling and the effect of publichealth interventions in India- SEIQHRF model","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.20182915","rel_abs":"A dynamic epidemic modeling, based on real time data, of COVID19 has been attempted for India and few selected Indian states .

We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA. Design: International network cohort Setting: Hospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea) Participants: patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020 Main outcome measures: Prescription\/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days after hospital admission date Analyses: Number and percentage of users overall and over time Results: 71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified. Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to 85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir\/ritonavir (<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability, with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in March-April but declined steeply in May-June. Conclusions: Multiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed medicines. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments. Research is needed on the comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anthony G.

An extension to the SEIR model allows us to consider the difference between the appearance (black-box view) of the spread of disease, and the real situation (glass-box view). Our model allows for simulations of lockdowns, social distancing, personal hygiene, quarantine, and hospitalization, with further considerations of different parameters such as the extent to which hygiene and social distancing are observed in a population. Our results give qualitative indications of the effects of various policies and parameters; for instance, that lockdowns by themselves are extremely unlikely to bring an end to an epidemic and may indeed make things worse, that social distancing matters more than personal hygiene, and that the growth of infection comes down significantly for moderately high levels of social distancing and hygiene, even in the absence of herd immunity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashutosh Trivedi","author_inst":"Spext Co."},{"author_name":"Nanda Kishore Sreenivas","author_inst":"Oracle"},{"author_name":"Shrisha Rao","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Waheed-Ul-Rahman Ahmed","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford; College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Heba Alghoul","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Islamic University of Gaza, Palestine"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"William Carter","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child\/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child\/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child\/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadie L Bell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Clarke","author_inst":"Newcastle University London"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mounier-Jack","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pauline Paterson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"William Carter","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

This has led to a drastic change in the routine management of non-communicable diseases with a potential long-term impact on patient health care. We investigated the management of non-COVID-19 patients across all medical specialties during the pandemic in Italy. Methods: A PRISMA guideline-based systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, restricting the search to the main outbreak period in Italy (from 20 February to 22 June, 2020). We selected articles in English or Italian that detailed changes in the Italian hospital care for non-COVID-19 patients due to the pandemic. Our keywords included all medical specialties in combination with our geographical focus (Italy) and COVID-19. Findings: Of the 4643 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 247 studies were included in the systematic review. A decrease in the management of emergencies in non-COVID patients was found together with an increase in mortality. Similarly, non-deferrable conditions met a tendency toward decreased diagnosis. All specialties have been affected by the reorganization of healthcare provision in the hub-and-spoke system and have benefited from telemedicine during the pandemic. Interpretation: Our work highlights the changes taking place in the Italian public healthcare system in order to tackle the developing health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of our review may be useful to analyze future directions for the healthcare system in the case of new pandemic scenarios.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianmarco Lugli","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Maria Ottaviani","author_inst":"Sant'Anna School of Avdanced Studies, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Botta","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Ascione","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac Surgery, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruschi","author_inst":"Rizzoli Orthopaedic Insititute, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Cagnazzo","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, Hopital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Zammarchi Lorenzo","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."},{"author_name":"Paola Romagnani","author_inst":"Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Portaluri","author_inst":"CEST Centre for Excellence and Transdisciplinary Studies, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Methods: A rapid systematic qualitative review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health, CINAHL and Web of Science. Included papers (i) report on primary qualitative studies (ii) of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of social distancing measures (iii) in potentially epidemic infectious diseases. After critical appraisal and standardised data extraction, a meta-ethnographical approach was used for synthesis. Review findings were assessed for strength and reliability using CerQUAL. Results: 28 papers were included from the systematic search that yielded 5620 results. One additional paper was found by searching references. The review identifies two broad categories of barriers to social distancing measures: individual- or community-level psychological or sociological phenomena, and perceived shortcomings in governmental action. Based on this, 25 themes are identified that can be addressed to improve the implementation of social distancing. Conclusion: There are many barriers, on different levels, to the implementation of social distancing measures. Among other findings, the review identifies the need for good communication as well as the need for authorities to provide comprehensive support as two key opportunities to increase acceptability and adherence. High-quality research is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic to better describe mechanisms by which implementation of social distancing can be improved, and, more importantly, what is already known has to be put into practice.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahan Sadjadi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katharina Selda Moerschel","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Petticrew","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guido Ascione","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac Surgery, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruschi","author_inst":"Rizzoli Orthopaedic Insititute, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Cagnazzo","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, Hopital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Zammarchi Lorenzo","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."},{"author_name":"Paola Romagnani","author_inst":"Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Portaluri","author_inst":"CEST Centre for Excellence and Transdisciplinary Studies, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

We conducted a nationwide survey to assess self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 across racial\/ethnic groups, including diverse subgroups of Asians. Results. Chinese respondents experienced the largest change (15% increase) in proportion of respondents reporting discrimination from 2019 to 2020 (P<.01). Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other API showed up to 3.9 times increased odds of self-reported racial\/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 and, with the addition of Filipino, experienced up to 5.4 times increased odds of concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 compared to Whites. Conclusions. Our study is the first to examine self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 in subgroups of Asian Americans, finding that East (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) and Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asian Americans have been disproportionately affected. Future studies should disaggregate Asian subgroups to fully understand experiences of discrimination in diverse populations in the US.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sierra K.

Objective: To determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission. Design: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to assess the relative importance of type of SARS-CoV-2 test, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Uptake of an optimized testing scenario was simulated relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in a provider office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. Setting: Online survey, embedded in an existing cohort study, conducted during July 30 - September 8, 2020. Participants: Participants (n=4,793) were enrolled in the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a national longitudinal cohort of adults >18 years residing in the 50 US states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, or Guam. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Relative importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing method attributes, utilities of specific attribute levels, and probability of choosing a testing scenario based on preferences estimated from the DCE, the current typical testing option, or choosing not to test. Results: Turnaround time for test results had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). Participants preferred fast results on both past and current infection and using a noninvasive specimen, preferably collected at home. Simulations suggested that providing immediate or same day test results, providing both PCR and serology, or collecting oral specimens would substantially increase testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test. Conclusions and Relevance: Testing strategies that offer both PCR and serology with non-invasive methods and rapid turnaround time would likely have the most uptake and engagement among residents in communities with increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Zimba","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Sarah Kulkarni","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Amanda Berry","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"William You","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Chloe Mirzayi","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Drew Westmoreland","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Angela Parcesepe","author_inst":"Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Levi Waldron","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Madhura Rane","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Shivani Kochhar","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"McKaylee Robertson","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Maroko","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Christian Grov","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Denis Nash","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"- for the CHASING COVID Cohort Study Team","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Daniel R Morales","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jose D Posada","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a lAtencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Elena Roel","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a lAtencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Karishma Shah","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nigam Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Materials and Methods: A published convolutional Siamese neural network-based model previously trained on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was tuned using 250 outpatient CXRs. This model produces a quantitative measure of COVID-19 lung disease severity (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score). The model was evaluated on CXRs from four test sets, including 3 from the United States (patients hospitalized at an academic medical center (N=154), patients hospitalized at a community hospital (N=113), and outpatients (N=108)) and 1 from Brazil (patients at an academic medical center emergency department (N=303)). Radiologists from both countries independently assigned reference standard CXR severity scores, which were correlated with the PXS scores as a measure of model performance (Pearson r). The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique was used to visualize the neural network results. Results: Tuning the deep learning model with outpatient data improved model performance in two United States hospitalized patient datasets (r=0.88 and r=0.90, compared to baseline r=0.86). Model performance was similar, though slightly lower, when tested on the United States outpatient and Brazil emergency department datasets (r=0.86 and r=0.85, respectively). UMAP showed that the model learned disease severity information that generalized across test sets.

The ability of G and GO to interact with and bind microorganisms as well as RNA and DNA provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE. The face masks widely used in health care and other high-risk settings for COVID transmission provide only a physical barrier that decreases likelihood of infection and do not inactivate the virus. Here, we show pre-incubation of viral particles with free GO inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells. Highly relevant to PPE materials, when either polyurethane or cotton material was loaded with G or GO and culture medium containing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles either filtered through or incubated with the functionalized materials, the infectivity of the medium was nearly completely inhibited. The findings presented here constitute an important nanomaterials-based strategy to significantly increase face mask and other PPE efficacy in protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 that may be applicable to additional anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures including water filtration, air purification, and diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57*10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8*10-24). Gene-based association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P = 2.58*10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunlong Ma","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yukuan Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325027, China"},{"author_name":"Sen Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yinghao Yao","author_inst":"Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wenzhou 325011, China"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

This paper estimates the causal effect of this measure on mortality by Covid-19 and on mobility patterns. The identification of the causal effect exploits the variation in the number of active workers across municipalities induced by the economic lockdown. The difference-in-difference empirical design compares outcomes in municipalities above and below the median variation in the share of active population before and after the lockdown within a province, also controlling for municipality-specific dynamics, daily-shocks at the provincial level and municipal unobserved characteristics. Our results show that the intensity of the economic lockdown is associated to a statistically significant reduction in mortality by Covid-19 and, in particular, for age groups between 40-64 and older. Back of the envelope calculations indicate that 4,793 deaths were avoided, in the 26 days between April 5 to April 30, in the 3,518 municipalities which experienced a more intense lockdown. Assuming linearity, a 1 percentage point reduction in the share of active population caused a 1.32 percentage points reduction in mortality by Covid-19. We also find that the economic lockdown, as expected, led to a reduction in human mobility. Several robustness checks corroborate our empirical findings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Borri","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Drago","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santantonio","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sobbrio","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density. COVID-19 testing through pharmacies can improve access across the US. Even if only few pharmacies offer testing, judicious selection of specific sites can simplify logistics and improve access.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Risanger","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bismark Singh","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg"},{"author_name":"David Morton","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

There are many COVID-19 studies in progress however, little is known about the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of our study was to describe epidemiology and clinical characteristics of PLWH diagnosed with COVID-19 reported form Central and Eastern European Countries. Methods: On-line survey was sent to Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group. Analysis included all confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 11 and June 26 2020 among PLWH in 12 countries: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland , Romania, Russia, and Serbia. Results: In total 34 cases were reported. The mean age of those patients was 42.7 years (IQR=35.8-48.5) and most of the patients were male (70.6% vs 29.4%). The mean CD4+ T-cell count prior COVID-19 diagnosis was 558 cells\/mm3 (IQR=312-719) and HIV RNA viral load (VL) was undetectable in 18 of 34 (53%) cases, the data about most recent HIV RNA VL was not available in three cases (8,8%). Comorbidities were observed in 19 (55.9%) patients, mostly cardiovascular disease (27,8%), and in 10 (29.4%) patients had coinfection, mostly chronic hepatitis C (87.5%). The clinical course of COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 4 (12%) cases, mild disease without hospitalization was reported in 11 (32%) cases. Stable patients with respiratory and\/or systemic symptoms have been documented in 14 (41%) cases; 5 (15%) patients were clinically unstable with respiratory failure. Full recovery was reported in 31 (91%) cases, two patients died. In one case the data was not available. Conclusion: This study from 12 countries in Central and Eastern Europe region indicates no alarming signals of increased morbidity or mortality from COVID-19 among HIV-positive persons there is a need for further research.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerstin Kase","author_inst":"West Tallinn Central Hospital, Estonia"},{"author_name":"Agata Skrzat-Klapaczynska","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Anne Vassilenko","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University, Minsk, Belarus"},{"author_name":"Arjan Harxhi","author_inst":"University Hospital Center of Tirana, Infectious Disease Service, Albania"},{"author_name":"Botond Lakatos","author_inst":"National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, South-Pest Central Hospital, National Center of HIV, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Gordana Dragovic Lukic","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine; University of Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"David Jilich","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Charles University in Prague and Na Bulovce Hospital, Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Antonija Verhaz","author_inst":"Infection Diseases Clinic, University Clinical Centre of the Republic of Srpska, Centre for Biomedical Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Banja Luka, "},{"author_name":"Nina Yancheva","author_inst":"Department for AIDS.

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% to 50% most of the time after February and America contributes close to 50% recently. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America is greater than 50% after May and even exceeds 75% in July, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike K.P.

Methods We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n=401) and healthy volunteers (n=100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. Results In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the detection rates of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the detection rates of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p=0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p=0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a higher detection rate of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p=0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The negative correctness of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that detection rates of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seow Yen Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hong Liang Tey","author_inst":"National Skin Centre"},{"author_name":"Ernest Tian Hong Lim","author_inst":"Woodlands Health Campus"},{"author_name":"Song Tar Toh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pei Ting Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sing Ai Lee","author_inst":"Sheares Healthcare Group Pte Ltd"},{"author_name":"Cheryl Xiaotong Tan","author_inst":"Temasek Holdings"},{"author_name":"Gerald Choon Huat Koh","author_inst":"MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation"},{"author_name":"Thean Yen Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuin Siau","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Horban","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Justyna Dominika Kowalska","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Michela Sali","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

We report that Kidney Injury Molecule-1\/T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 1 (KIM-1\/TIM-1) is expressed in lung and kidney epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients and is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Human and mouse lung and kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1 and endocytose nanoparticles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (virosomes). Uptake was inhibited both by anti-KIM-1 antibodies and by TW-37, our newly discovered inhibitor of KIM-1-mediated endocytosis. Enhanced KIM-1 expression by human kidney tubuloids increased uptake of virosomes. KIM-1 positive cells express less angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the well-known receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using microscale thermophoresis, the EC50 for KIM-1-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) interactions, were 19 and 10 nM respectively. Thus KIM-1 is an alternative receptor to ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2.

Methods Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3\/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38\/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51\/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). Conclusions The frequency of a\/presymptomatic residents compared to staff suggests that a\/presymptomatic residents could be unrecognized symptomatic cases. However, symptomatic and presymptomatic\/unrecognized symptomatic residents both have the same potential for viral shedding. The high prevalence symptomatic staff found in facility-wide testing suggests that staff has difficulty attributing their symptoms to possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast isolation and mitigation of this outbreak.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judith Henriette van den Besselaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Fleur M.H.P.A.

This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Methods: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Results: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Conclusions: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan M Pace","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Janet E Williams","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Kirsi M J\u00e4rvinen","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mandy B Belfort","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christina DW Pace","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Kimberly A Lackey","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C Gogel","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Phuong Nguyen-Contant","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Preshetha Kanagaiah","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Theresa Fitzgerald","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rita Ferri","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bridget Young","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casey Rosen-Carole","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nichole Diaz","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Courtney Meehan","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Caffe","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Y Sangster","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David  J Topham","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark A McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Antti Seppo","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Detecting antibodies against the virus is an essential tool for tracking infections and developing vaccines. Such tests, primarily utilizing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle, can be either qualitative (reporting positive\/negative results) or quantitative (reporting a value representing the quantity of specific antibodies). Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections. Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series. To overcome the throughput limitations of this approach, we developed a simpler and faster system that is highly automatable and achieves quantitation in a single-dilution screening format with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of ELISA.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Markus H Kainulainen","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Eric Bergeron","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Payel Chatterjee","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asheley P Chapman","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joo Lee","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asiya Chida","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Tang","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Rebekah E Wharton","author_inst":"Emergency Response Branch, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristina B Mercer","author_inst":"Newborn Screening & Molecular Biology Branch, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Marla Petway","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Harley M Jenks","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. To this end, we evaluated several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, we show that isopropanol precipitation provides an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, we evaluate direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCR reactions without an RNA extraction step. We describe a simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition, which we validate using contrived swab samples. Third, we describe an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR and show that it permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples. Lastly, we show that an end-point fluorescence measurement provides an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, inexpensive methods has the potential to significantly reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas G.W.

One sample from the initial days of the pandemic in the state and 4 during the peak in Oklahoma were sequenced. Previously reported mutations including D614G in S gene, P4715L in ORF1ab, S194L, R203K and G204R in N gene were identified in the genomes sequenced in this study. Possible novel mutations were also detected such as G1167V in S gene, A6269S and P3371S in ORF1ab, T28I in ORF7b, G96R in ORF8. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes showed similarity to viruses from across the globe.

Design or methods We conducted a cross-sectional and a prospective study among medical doctors and medical trainees at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota (Colombia) during June, July, and August to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in this population was performed using CLA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLA IgG. Results At baseline, 8 (2.28% 95%CI 1.16-4.43%) individuals were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98% 95%CI 3.94-8.97%) individuals seroconverted by CLA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLA and of these 11 (3.13% 95%CI 1.76-5.52%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLA had moderate concordance with LFA IgG and ELFA, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusions Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection\/disease spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz Elena Ariza","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Yulieth Ximena Torres","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Diana Salgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Magda Cepeda","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gomez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Julio Cesar Castellanos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Fernando Suarez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Adriana Cuellar","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Claudia Cecilia Cardozo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Juana Angel","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

In this terrible scenario, Italy was one of the most affected countries. ------------ Objective: The aim of this study is to look for significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. Finally, we further investigated the link between SARS-CoV-2 spread and particulate matter 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. ------------ Methods: All demographic data were taken from the AdminStat Italia website, while the geographic data from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was 1 week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. To evaluate this, we used the kurtosis (k) and skewness (s) coefficients according to the following scheme: we considered data compatible with a normal distribution only when t_k=k(24\/n)^(-1\/2) [&le;] 1.5 and t_s=s(6\/n)^(-1\/2) [&le;] 1.5; here, the Pearson correlation index was deemed more reliable. When t_k in ]1.5,3],t_s [&le;] 3 or t_k [&le;] 3, t_s in ]1.5,3], we considered it appropriate to evaluate both correlations. Finally, when t_k,t_s > 3, we judged the Spearman correlation index more appropriate. When the linear correlations were significant, we interpolated the data linearly. We reported in round brackets () the week in which the correlation approached the threshold of statistical significance e.g. Abruzzo (4). The chosen p-value threshold was =.05. ------------ Results: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population density in 60.0% of regions, such as Calabria (5), Campania (1), Lazio (1), Liguria (2), Lombardy (4), Piedmont (2), Sardinia (3), Sicily (1), and Veneto (4) (R_best=.935, 95% CI: .830 -1.000,p_best=.046,95% CI:.006-.040). The average of the angular coefficients resulting from the linear interpolations of the pairs (COVID-19 cases, population number) is b=.0037 (95% CI .0009-.0065). We found a significant strong correlation between the angular coefficients b of the various regions and their latitude. This data shows the dependence of COVID-19 on geographical and\/or climatic factors (R=.926,p=.001,r=.886,p=.003). in particular, we found a significant correlation with the historical averages (last 30 years) of the minimum temperatures of the Italian regions (R=-.849,p=.008,r=-.940,p=.005 for March, R=-.923,p=.001,r=-.872,p = .005 for February). We found a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020 (r=.76,p=.004). No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. Until February 26, 2020, we found both a correlation with PM2.5 (r=.63,p=.029) and PM10 (r=.72,p=.009). In the second week of March, the correlation with PM10 disappeared while that with PM2.5 continued to exist until nowadays. We found that 40 g\/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g\/m^3 for PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. ------------ Conclusion: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and particulate matter 10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in closed places and to avoid exposure to cold.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessandro Rovetta","author_inst":"Mensana srls, Via Moro Aldo 5, Brescia (IT)"},{"author_name":"Lucia Castaldo","author_inst":"Mensana srls, Via Moro Aldo 5, Brescia (IT)"},{"author_name":"Aparna Pande","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anirban Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amrita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dalim Kumar Baidya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar Anand","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Ranjan Ray","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajeshwari Subramaniam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maitra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) for individual year classes calculated from seroprevalence data and the ages of those dying in England show a very strong log-linear relationship with age, and allow us to predict fatality rates for those testing positive on each day based on their ages. Since the peak of the epidemic, reductions in the ages of cases account for an eight fold fall in fatality rates. Over the same period, increased testing intensity appears to have increased infections detected amongst the most vulnerable by a factor of at least five, and between 15 and 24 fold in the population as a whole. Together these two factors are sufficient to explain the large observed change in the ratio of deaths to reported cases. We can also use these methods to give a more precise early warning system of future increases in mortality rates than raw case numbers. Although case numbers are currently increasing markedly, a continuing reduction in numbers of older individuals being infected means that the predicted increase in mortality rates is much slower.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alastair Grant","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Lucia Castaldo","author_inst":"Mensana srls, Via Moro Aldo 5, Brescia (IT)"},{"author_name":"Aparna Pande","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anirban Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amrita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dalim Kumar Baidya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar Anand","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Ranjan Ray","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajeshwari Subramaniam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maitra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Moreover, not all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are detected (laboratory diagnosed). Here, we examine the relation between detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the percent of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) and levels of mortality for COVID-19 for the 85 different regions (federal subjects) of the Russian Federation. Methods: Lower case-fatality rate (CFR, the proportion of deaths among reported COVID-19 cases in the population) corresponds to higher detectability of the SARS-COV-2 infection. We used data from the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation to examine the correlation between case-fatality rates and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality rates for cases\/deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 and rates of mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 for deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 in different regions of the Russian Federation is 0.68 (0.55,0.78). The region with both the highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 and the highest CFR (lowest detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection) is the city of St. Petersburg. Conclusions: Detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality for COVID-19 in Russia. Regions of the Russian Federation with relatively low detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g. those regions for which the case-fatality rate is above the median value of 1.2% for the case-fatality rate in different regions of the Russian Federation on Sep. 17, 2020 [3]) ought to increase testing for SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and diminish the related mortality.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Goldstein","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Castaldo","author_inst":"Mensana srls, Via Moro Aldo 5, Brescia (IT)"},{"author_name":"Aparna Pande","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anirban Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amrita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dalim Kumar Baidya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar Anand","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Ranjan Ray","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajeshwari Subramaniam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maitra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"David Vizcaya","author_inst":"Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Sant Joan Despi, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Population Medicine and Public Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College; School of Population and Global Health, T"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.
