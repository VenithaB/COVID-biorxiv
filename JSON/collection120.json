Masks have proven to be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined by state policy. It is found that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Maloney","author_inst":"Proof School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.03.20206193","rel_title":"Development and comparison of a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay with other nucleic acid amplification methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.03.20206193","rel_abs":"Objectives: To develop a novel multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay for COVID-19 and compare its speed and sensitivity to existing loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods. Methods: Two MCDA assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab was designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and RT-PCR using 7 DNA standards and transcribed RNA. Results: For the N gene, MCDA was consistently faster than LAMP and RT-PCR by 10 and 20 minutes, respectively with a fastest time to detection of 5.2 minutes. RT-PCR had the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of 100 copies\/reaction compared with MCDA (1000 copies\/reaction) and LAMP (5000\/reaction). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 minutes, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 500 copies\/reaction compared to MCDA (5000 copies\/reaction). Conclusions: Different nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages. MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method for COVID-19 while RT-PCR is still the most sensitive. These advantages should be considered when determining the most suitable nucleic acid amplification methods for different applications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurence Don Wai Luu","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Michael J Payne","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Zhang","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Luo","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Ruiting Lan","author_inst":"The University of New South Wales"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.04.20206466","rel_title":"Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection by immunofluorescence - a new tool to detect infectivity","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.04.20206466","rel_abs":"The evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid fluorescence immunoassays reliably identified patients within the first 5 days of symptom onset, when respiratory secretions carried high viral loads.

To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from all published studies. Methods and Findings: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and\/or the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31).

Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals ([&le;]5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at [&le;]5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained [&ge;]21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

Based on empirical work (total n=5,520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing (for balance) a format which conveys a higher perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10,000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative 'persona' who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other 'personas' illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These 'personas' should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra LJ Freeman","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Kerr","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Recchia","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Claudia Schneider","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alice CE Lawrence","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Leila Finikarides","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Giulia Luoni","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dryhurst","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Mary Caserta","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Angeloni","author_inst":"Luminex"},{"author_name":"Dwight J Hardy","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Martin Zand","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Nicole Danielle Pecora","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.03.20205765","rel_title":"Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of household-pooled universal testing to control COVID-19 epidemics","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.03.20205765","rel_abs":"Current outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics currently relies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow the for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when much of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that, the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions, could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pieter Jules Karel Libin","author_inst":"Data science institute"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Timothy Verstraeten","author_inst":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Joris Vanderlocht","author_inst":"Universiteit Hasselt"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Giulia Luoni","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dryhurst","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Mary Caserta","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Angeloni","author_inst":"Luminex"},{"author_name":"Dwight J Hardy","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Martin Zand","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Nicole Danielle Pecora","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.03.20206151","rel_title":"Impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals on COVID-19 mortality in different countries","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.03.20206151","rel_abs":"Several recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus. However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gennadi Glinsky","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Timothy Verstraeten","author_inst":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Joris Vanderlocht","author_inst":"Universiteit Hasselt"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Giulia Luoni","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dryhurst","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Spiegelhalter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Mary Caserta","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Angeloni","author_inst":"Luminex"},{"author_name":"Dwight J Hardy","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Martin Zand","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Nicole Danielle Pecora","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.03.20206243","rel_title":"Diagnostic performance of the combined nasal and throat swab in patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.03.20206243","rel_abs":"Background: Accurate diagnosis in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential to guide treatment and limit spread of the virus. The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. Methods: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. Results: We enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496\/1,369), of whom 65% (323\/496) and 35% (173\/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255\/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%).

Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit. Methods: This was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal\/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. Results: Ninety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent. High retention rates (88.9% - 93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. A self-collected nasal\/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation. Conclusion: Voluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters. Program planning must consider needs and life situation of homeless people, and guarantee confidentiality and autonomy.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas K.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline results (April 22 - April 26) of an ongoing cohort study. All staff who were present in the hospital during the sampling period and whose profession involved contact with patients were eligible. Fourteen hospitals across Belgium and 50 HCW per hospital were randomly selected. RT-qPCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs, and a semi-quantitative IgG ELISA was used to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera. Individual characteristics likely to be associated with seropositivity were collected using an online questionnaire. Findings: 698 participants completed the questionnaire; 80.8% were women, median age was 39.5, and 58.5% were nurses. Samples were collected on all 699 participants.

Unprotected contact with a confirmed case was the only factor associated with seropositivity (PR 2.16, 95% CI, 1.4-3.2). Interpretation: Most Belgian HCW did not show evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by late April 2020, and unprotected contact was the most important risk factor. This confirms the importance of widespread availability of protective equipment and use of adequate IPC measures in hospital settings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laure Mortgat","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels; EPIET, Stockholm"},{"author_name":"Cyril Barbezange","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Natalie Fischer","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels; EUPHEM, Stockholm"},{"author_name":"Leo Heyndrickx","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Veronik Hutse","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Thomas","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Bea Vuylsteke","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Kevin Arien","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp; University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Desombere","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Els Duysburgh","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Anke Edelmann","author_inst":"Labor Berlin - Charit\u00e9 Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Equihua Martinez","author_inst":"Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt - Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute "},{"author_name":"Frank P.

It has been proposed that this may be driven by a direct diabetogenic effect of the virus that is unique to SARS-CoV-2, but evidence to support this is limited. To explore this, we compared insulin requirements in patients with severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis. Research Design Retrospective cohort study of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March and June 2020. A historical control cohort of non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis patients was identified from routinely collected audit data. Results Insulin requirements were similar in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonitis after adjustment for pre-existing diabetes and severity of respiratory failure. Conclusions In this single center study, we could not find evidence of a unique diabetogenic effect of COVID-19. We suggest that high insulin requirements in this disease relate to its propensity to cause severe respiratory failure in patients with pre-existing metabolic disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sam Lockhart","author_inst":"1.\tMRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."},{"author_name":"Harry Griffiths","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bogdan Petrisor","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ammara Usman","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Julia Calvo-Latorre","author_inst":"Wolfson Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Laura Heales","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Vishakha Bansiya","author_inst":"Wolfson Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Els Duysburgh","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Anke Edelmann","author_inst":"Labor Berlin - Charit\u00e9 Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Equihua Martinez","author_inst":"Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt - Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute "},{"author_name":"Frank P.

To understand factors influencing patient decision to attend hospital, we performed a local service evaluation project in NHS Lothian. Methods: We collated data on online searches and local clinical services on the number of ED presentations and chest pain clinic (CPC) referrals with suspected acute coronary syndrome between January and May 2020 and compared findings with the same period in 2019. We also carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and salient themes and issues documented as verbatim extracts. Results: Online searches for the term chest pain doubled after 01\/03\/2020, peaking in week commencing 22\/03\/2020 and returning to 2019 levels during April 2020. In contrast, chest pain presentations to ED and CPC decreased, with the greatest reduction in the final week of March 2020 (128 v 287 (average weekly ED attendance 2019), and 6 v 23 (average weekly CPC referral 2019)). This aligned with key government messages to Protect the NHS and the NHS is open campaign. Patient interviews revealed three main themes; 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; 3) favourable Hospital experience if admitted. Conclusions: Dynamic monitoring of public health and media messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy V Ferry","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Collette Keanie","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Martin A Denvir","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas L Mills","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fiona E Strachan","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Laura Heales","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Vishakha Bansiya","author_inst":"Wolfson Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Razeen Mahroof","author_inst":"John V Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Els Duysburgh","author_inst":"Sciensano, Brussels"},{"author_name":"Anke Edelmann","author_inst":"Labor Berlin - Charit\u00e9 Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Equihua Martinez","author_inst":"Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt - Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health; Institute "},{"author_name":"Frank P.

This has led to much speculation about the role of vitamin D in healthcare worker COVID-19 infections. We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in NHS staff who have isolated with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and relate this to vitamin D status. Methods: We recruited NHS healthcare workers between 12th to 22nd May 2020 as part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). We measured anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies using a combined IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA (The Binding Site). Vitamin D status was determined by measurement of serum 25(OH)D3 using the AB SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 mass spectrometry system. Findings: Of the 392 NHS healthcare workers, 214 (55%) had seroconverted for COVID-19. A total of 61 (15{middle dot}6%) members of staff were vitamin D deficient (<30 nmol\/l) with significantly more staff from BAME backgrounds or in a junior doctor role being deficient. Vitamin D levels were lower in those who were younger, had a higher BMI (>30 kg\/m2), and were male. Multivariate analysis revealed that BAME and COVID-19 seroconversion were independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency. Staff who were vitamin D deficient were more likely to self-report symptoms of body aches and pains but importantly not the respiratory symptoms of cough and breathlessness. Vitamin D levels were lower in those COVID-19 positive staff who reported fever, but this did not reach statistical significance. Within the whole cohort there was an increase in seroconversion in staff with vitamin D deficiency compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (n=44\/61, 72% vs n=170\/331, 51%; p=0{middle dot} 003); this was particularly marked in the proportion of BAME males who were vitamin D deficient compared to non-vitamin D deficient BAME males (n=17\/18, 94% vs n=12\/23, 52%; p=0{middle dot}005). Multivariate analysis revealed that vitamin D deficiency was an independent risk factor for seroconversion (OR 2{middle dot}6, 95%CI 1{middle dot}41- 4{middle dot} 80; p=0{middle dot}002). Interpretation: In those healthcare workers who have isolated due to symptoms of COVID-19, those of BAME ethnicity are at the highest risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Existing COVID-19 case definitions were developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control. Methods: We collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F-1 score, Youden's index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults. Findings: Common COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (86-96%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (36-49%; F-1 score 52-63) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F-1 score 78-80) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age). Interpretation: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be further explored.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah E.

Meta-population epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health and shaping policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intra-county environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different sub-regions. To address this issue, we develop a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behavior. This new modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and human mobility, business foot-traffic, race & ethnicity, and age-group are then investigated. The results reveal that in a college town (Dane County) the most important heterogeneity is spatial, while in a large city area (Milwaukee County) racial-ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate on various reopening policies, which suggests that policymakers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Hou","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"Geospatial Data Science Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Qin Li","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Kang","author_inst":"Geospatial Data Science Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Nan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kaiping Chen","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences Communication, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jinmeng Rao","author_inst":"Geospatial Data Science Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jordan S.

To understand what levels of herd immunity are required in the COVID-19 pandemic, given spatial population heterogeneity, to best inform policy and action. Methods. Using a network of counties in the United States connected by transit data we considered a set of coupled differential equations for susceptible-infectious-removed populations. We calculated the classical herd immunity level plus a version reflecting the heterogeneity of connections in the network by running the model forward in time until the epidemic completed. Results. Necessary levels of herd immunity vary greatly from county to county. A population weighted average for the United States is 47.5% compared to a classically estimated level of 77.1%. Conclusions. Common thinking argues that the nation needs to achieve at least 60% herd immunity to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity in contact structure and individual variation in infectivity, susceptibility, and resistance are key factors that reduce the disease-induced herd immunity levels to 34.2-47.5% in our models. Looking forward toward vaccination strategies, these results suggest we should consider not just who is vaccinated but where those vaccinations will do the most good.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalie Elizabeth Sheils","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Lyng","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Ethan M Berke","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Kang","author_inst":"Geospatial Data Science Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Nan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kaiping Chen","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences Communication, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jinmeng Rao","author_inst":"Geospatial Data Science Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jordan S.

A plateau in cases followed by an increase approximately 1.5 months after is also observed. In terms of deaths, the data fits the shape of the model, but the model mostly underestimates the death toll after around 160 days. An analysis of the residuals is provided to locate the precise date of the departure of each country from its accepted data estimates and test each data point to its predicted value using a Z-test to determine whether each observation can fit the given model. The observed behavior is matched to policy measures taken in each country to attach an explanation to these observations.

In this paper, we present a data-informed approach for building stochastic compartmental models that is grounded in the Markovian processes underlying these models. Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model -- susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) -- is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V). Using the proposed model, we characterize delay distributions analytically and match model parameters to empirical quantities in the data to obtain a good model fit. Insights from an epidemiological perspective are presented, as well as their implications for mitigation and control strategies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sukru Yagiz Olmez","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Jameson Mori","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Erik Miehling","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Tamer Basar","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Lee Smith","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Matthew West","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Prashant Mehta","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Jordan S.

Outcomes were parent-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family life, concerns and trust in political measures. Results: Most families were concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down measures, with major concerns directed towards the economic situation (>70%), the health of close-ones (37%), but less towards their own health (<10%). Many concerns, seeking information and approval of federal measures were more pronounced in the more affected region. Approval of lockdown measures and concerns about economic recession were related to regional differences and not significantly dependent on educational status or being personally affected by the disease. Conclusion: Regional differences in approval of lockdown measures were observed and thus, measures to specifically support families according to the regional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susanne Branstetter","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO), Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Steinmetzstr., 1-3, 93049 Regensburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tanja Poulain","author_inst":"LIFE Child, LIFE Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, Leipzig University, Philipp-Rosenthal-Strasse 27, 04103 Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mandy Vogel","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"Christof Meigen","author_inst":"LIFE Child, LIFE Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, Leipzig University, Philipp-Rosenthal-Strasse 27, 04103 Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Melter","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO), Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Steinmetzstr., 1-3, 93049 Regensburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Birgit Seelbach-Goebel","author_inst":"Member of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Ger"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Member of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Ger"},{"author_name":"Wieland Kiess","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"Michael Kabesch","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO), Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Steinmetzstr., 1-3, 93049 Regensburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Antje Koerner","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"- U.S. COVID-19 Household Investigation Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Jacqueline E.

Objectives: To examine the associations between all-cause mortality and daily PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in the pandemic period, and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily data regarding all-cause (stratified by age and gender), and PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak (March to May in 2020) and the same months in 2015-2019. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. Results: Overall, Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in 2020 pandemic period compared to same months of 2015-2019. Mortality effects were significant in lag 0-3 days for PM2.5, lag 0-2 for PM10, and lag 0-1 for PM2.5-10. Each 10 g\/m3 increase in PM was associated much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during 2020 pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 [increased mortality rate: 7.24 % (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45 % (95%C: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10, 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10]. The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 than the normal periods for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 in 2020 versus 3,927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3,999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7,193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%). Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level. This suggests using historical PM-mortality association to calculate health benefits associated with reduction in PMs has big uncertainties.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingting Ye","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rongbin Xu","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Yu","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyue Chen","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Yuming Guo","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Li","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Member of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Ger"},{"author_name":"Wieland Kiess","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"Michael Kabesch","author_inst":"University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO), Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Steinmetzstr., 1-3, 93049 Regensburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Antje Koerner","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"- U.S. COVID-19 Household Investigation Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Jacqueline E.

Study design: The study used a synthetic population with 31,738,240 agents representing 90.67 percent of the overall population of Telangana state, India as per 2011 Census of India. Lockdown phases as per Indian scenario considering the effects of post-lockdown, use of control measures and immunity on secondary infections were studied. District-level localized parameters were assigned to agents as local models prove to be much helpful for policymakers. Methods: The counts of people in different health states were measured separately for each district of Telangana. The model was run for 365 days and six scenarios with varying proportions of people using control measures (100%, 75% and 50%) and varying immunity periods of recovered patients (90 and 180 days). Results: Results indicate that the peak values were attained soon after the lockdown was lifted. The risk estimates indicate that protection factor values are higher when more proportion of people adopt control measures such as use of face mask and social distancing. Population Attributable Risk values measured longitudinally indicated higher values like 60.41% and 47.18% when 75 percent of people followed control measures during lockdowns. Conclusions: ABM approach helps to analyze grassroot details compared to compartmental models. Risk estimates allows the policymakers to determine the protection offered, its strength and percentage of population shielded by use of control measures.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Narassima MS","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa  Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Guru Rajesh Jammy","author_inst":"Society for Health, Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA), Telangana, India."},{"author_name":"Sankarshana A","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Pant","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Anbuudayasankar SP","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Choudhury","author_inst":"Krashapana Consultancy Private limited, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Vijay Yeldandi","author_inst":"Society for Health, Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA), Telangana, India."},{"author_name":"Shubham Singh","author_inst":"Tata Consultancy Services Limited"},{"author_name":"Denny John","author_inst":"Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kochi, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Antje Koerner","author_inst":"Department of Women and Child Health, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, and Center for Pediatric Research, Leipzig University, Liebigstrasse 20a"},{"author_name":"- U.S. COVID-19 Household Investigation Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Jacqueline E.

This study describes a rapid and effective UVC irradiation system that would facilitate the safe re-use of N95 respirators and provides supporting information for deploying UVC for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID19 pandemic. Objective: To assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a function of time by using 3M 8211 - N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Design: A germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and snippets (2.5cm2) of the 3M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0-164 seconds) by fixing the distance between the lamp (10 cm) and the mask while providing an exposure of at least 5.43 mWcm-2. Setting: The current work is broadly applicable for healthcare-settings, particularly during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Participants: Not applicable. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus recovered from virus-inoculated respirator pieces after UVC exposure. Other measures included the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol. Results: An average of 4.38x103 PFUml-1(SD 772.68) was recovered from untreated masks while 4.44x102 PFUml-1(SD 203.67), 4.00x102 PFUml-1(SD 115.47), 1.56x102 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) and 4.44x101 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) was recovered in exposures 2s,6s,18s and 54 seconds per side respectively. The germicidal device output and positioning was monitored and a minimum output of 5.43 mWcm-2 was maintained. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by plaque assays (minimal level of detection is 67 PFUml-1) on N95 respirator snippets when irradiated for 120s per side or longer suggesting 3.5 log reduction in 240 seconds of irradiation. Conclusions and Relevance: A scalable germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. UVC germicidal irradiation of N95 snippets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 120s per side resulted in 100% (3.5 log in total) reduction of virus. These data support the reuse of N95 particle-filtrate apparatus upon irradiation with UVC and supports use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raveen Rathnasinghe","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert F Karlicek","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Schotsaert","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mattheos A Koffas","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Arduini","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Sonia Jangra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bowen Wang","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason L.

However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the human eye to date. We undertook this study to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues. Methods: The expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR in corneal and scleral tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors who were eliminated from a surgical use per Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) donor screening guidelines or medical director review or positive COVID-19 test. Ocular levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR), Envelope and Spike proteins (immunohistochemistry) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies (ELISA) in blood were evaluated in 10 COVID-19 donors. Findings: Of 132 ocular tissues from 33 surgical-intended donors, the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was ~13% (17\/132). Of 10 COVID-19 donors, six had PCR positive post-mortem nasopharyngeal swabs whereas eight exhibited positive post-mortem anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. Among 20 eyes recovered from 10 COVID-19 donors: three conjunctival, one anterior corneal, five posterior corneal, and three vitreous swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins were detected in epithelial layer of the corneas that were procured without Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) disinfection. Interpretations: Our study showed a small but noteworthy prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular tissues from COVID-19 donors. These findings underscore the criticality of donor screening guidelines, post-mortem nasopharyngeal PCR testing and PVP-I disinfection protocol to eliminate any tissue harboring SARS-CoV-2 being used for corneal transplantation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onkar B Sawant","author_inst":"Center for Vision and Eye Banking Research, 6700 Euclid Ave, Suite 101, Eversight, Cleveland, OH 44103, USA."},{"author_name":"Sneha Singh","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Visual and Anatomical Sciences, Wayne State University, 4717 St. Antoine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Emery Wright III","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Visual and Anatomical Sciences, Wayne State University, 4717 St. Antoine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA"},{"author_name":"Kayla M Jones","author_inst":"Center for Vision and Eye Banking Research, 6700 Euclid Ave, Suite 101, Eversight, Cleveland, OH 44103, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael S Titus","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Operations, Eversight, 3985 Research Park Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA"},{"author_name":"Eugene Dennis","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Operations, Eversight, 77 Brant Ave, Clark, NJ 07066, USA"},{"author_name":"Eric Hicks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Operations, Eversight, 3985 Research Park Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA"},{"author_name":"Parag A Majmudar","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Rush University, 1725 W.

Smoking has been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the consequent risk for intra-tracheal ventilation in smokers. Tobacco smoking exposes the user and nearby individuals to very high concentrations of particulate matter in a short period of time. Genes appertaining to COVID-19 have been found adherent to particulate matter. Particulate matter has been shown to travel beyond the social distance of 2 metres up to 10 metres. COVID-19 related mortality has been linked to elevated atmospheric levels of the particulate matter, PM2.5. The aim of the study was to observe the incidence of infection rate and case fatality ratios in the USA, comparing States with partial bans on tobacco smoking, to States with more restrictive smoking regulation, exploring a possible link between smoke-related particulate matter and COVID-19 transmission. METHODOLOGY: Two groups of USA States, differentiated by the degree of smoking legislative restrictions, had a number of variables compared. The incidence of COVID-19 infection, case-fatality ratio and testing frequency were obtained from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre. The degree of smoking bans in the USA States was obtained from the websites of the Nonsmokers Rights Foundation. The percentage of the State population which smokes was collected from the Centres of Disease Control database. Population density, Body Mass Index and population percentages of individuals 65+\/75+years were obtained from databases concerning USA demographics. RESULTS: With the available data there was no significant difference in COVID-19 testing prevalence between the partial smoking ban group and the more restrictive regulated group. The incidence of COVID-19 infection in the States with limited bans on tobacco smoking was 2046\/100,000 (sd+\/-827) while the infection incidence in States with more restrictive rulings on tobacco smoking was 1660\/100,000 (sd+\/-686) (p<0.038). The population percentage of smokers in States with minor limitations to smoking was 18.3% (sd+\/-3.28), while States with greater smoking restrictions had a smoking population percentage of 15.2% (sd+\/-2.68) (p<0.0006). The two populations of both groups did not differ numerically (p<0.24) and numbered 157,820,000 in the partial smoking ban group and 161,439,356 in the more restrictive group. Population density correlated significantly with the case-fatality ratio (R=0.66 p<0.0001), as did the 75+year age group (R=0.29 p<0.04). Reflecting the possibility of trans-border transmission, the smoking status of adjacent partial smoking ban States may influence the COVID-19 incidence of bordering States (e.g. Utah) even if the smoking regulations of the latter were stricter than the former. Other factors that could impact the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA such as the State case-fatality ratio, population density, population percentage with elevated body mass index and the percentage of the state population aged 65years or above did not show any significant difference between both groups of States. CONCLUSION: States in the USA with high levels of tobacco smoking and limited regulation had significantly higher rates of COVID-19 infection incidences than States with greater smoking restrictions. Population density and the age group of 75+years, showed a positive significant correlation with the case-fatality ratio. Besides the adverse effects of tobacco smoking on pulmonary defences, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of infection transmission via coronavirus-laden particulate matter from exhaled fumes derived from tobacco smoking.

Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context. Methodology We identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. Results The study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3%) were males. 159 (72.3%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1% vs. 12.6%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2% vs. 69.8%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8% vs. 12.1%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3% vs. 24.5%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8% vs. 22.6%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253 x 10^9\/L vs. 185 x10^9\/L, p=0.02). Conclusions Most cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths. Pranayama practice was associated with protection against severe COVID-19, but more data is needed to substantiate this. The association of platelets count with symptom status in the Nepalese population needs further exploration.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashok Chaudhary","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Uday Narayan Singh","author_inst":"Narayani Hospital,Birgunj, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Pramod Paudel","author_inst":"Bharatpur Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Niresh Thapa","author_inst":"Karnali Academy of Health Sciences, Jumla, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kamal Khadka","author_inst":"Rapti Provincial Hospital, Tulsipur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Prameshwar Kumar Sah","author_inst":"Narayani Hospital, Birgunj, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sher Bahadur Kamar","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Jagadish Joshi","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kamar Hasan Ansari","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shree Ram Tiwari","author_inst":"Bharatpur Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sarbesh Sharma","author_inst":"Rapti Provincial Hospital, Tulsipur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal","author_inst":"Anamnagar Diagnostic Center and Polyclinic, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Joshi","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Samikchya Baskota","author_inst":"Anamnagar Diagnostic Center and Polyclinic, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Arjun Prasad Tiwari","author_inst":"Karnali Academy of Health Sciences, Jumla, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Hem Raj Pandey","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.06.20207662","rel_title":"Which factors should be included in triage?

This study aimed to help inform triage guidance by exploring the view of lay people about factors to include in triage decisions. Design, setting and participants: Online survey between 29th May and 22nd June 2020 based on hypothetical triage dilemmas. Participants recruited from existing market research panels, representative of the UK general population. Scenarios were presented in which a single ventilator is available, and two patients require ICU admission and ventilation. Patients differed in one of: chance of survival, life expectancy, age, expected length of treatment, disability, and degree of frailty. Respondents were given the option of choosing one patient to treat, or tossing a coin to decide. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-three participated. A majority of respondents prioritized patients who would have a higher chance of survival (72-93%), longer life expectancy (78-83%), required shorter duration of treatment (88-94%), were younger (71-79%), or had a lesser degree of frailty (60- 69% all p< .001). Where there was a small difference between two patients, a larger proportion elected to toss a coin to decide which patient to treat. A majority (58-86%) were prepared to withdraw treatment from a patient in intensive care who had a lower chance of survival than another patient currently presenting with COVID-19. Respondents also indicated a willingness to give higher priority to healthcare workers and to patients with young children. Conclusion: Members of the UK general public potentially support a broadly utilitarian approach to ICU triage in the face of overwhelming need. Survey respondents endorsed the relevance of patient factors currently included in triage guidance, but also factors not currently included. They supported the permissibility of reallocating treatment in a pandemic","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominic Wilkinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hazem Zohny","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andreas Kappes","author_inst":"City, University of London"},{"author_name":"Walter Sinnott-Armstrong","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Julian Savulescu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Prameshwar Kumar Sah","author_inst":"Narayani Hospital, Birgunj, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sher Bahadur Kamar","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Jagadish Joshi","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kamar Hasan Ansari","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shree Ram Tiwari","author_inst":"Bharatpur Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sarbesh Sharma","author_inst":"Rapti Provincial Hospital, Tulsipur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal","author_inst":"Anamnagar Diagnostic Center and Polyclinic, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Joshi","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Samikchya Baskota","author_inst":"Anamnagar Diagnostic Center and Polyclinic, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Arjun Prasad Tiwari","author_inst":"Karnali Academy of Health Sciences, Jumla, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Hem Raj Pandey","author_inst":"Seti Provincial Hospital, Dhangadhi, Nepal"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical ethics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20199562","rel_title":"Pathogenesis-based pre-exposure prophylaxis associated with low risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers at a designated Covid-19 hospital","rel_date":"2020-10-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20199562","rel_abs":"At present, no agents are known to be effective in preventing Covid-19. Based on current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be attenuated by directly maintaining innate pulmonary redox, metabolic and dilation functions using well-tolerated medications that are known to serve these functions, specifically, using a low dose aerosolized combination of glutathione, inosine and potassium. From June 1 to July 10, 2020, we conducted a low-intervention open-label single-centre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the aerosolized combination medications (ACM) on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in 99 healthcare workers (HCWs) at a hospital that was designated to treat Covid-19 patients. We also retrospectively compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the ACM users to that in 268 untreated HCWs at the same hospital. Eligible participants received an aerosolized combination of 21.3 mg\/ml glutathione, 8.7 mg\/ml inosine in 107 mM potassium solution for 14 days. The main outcome was the frequency of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, defined as individuals with positive genetic or immunological tests within 28 days of the study period. During the PrEP period, solicited adverse events occurred in five participants; all were mild and transient reactions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 2 ACM users (2%, 95% CI: 0.3% to 7.1%), which was significantly less than the incidence in 24 nonusers (9%, 95% CI: 5.8% to 13.0%; P = 0.02). Our findings might be used either to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to support ongoing and new research into more effective treatments for Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael V.
