Using the WHO health emergency and disaster risk management (health-EDRM) framework, behavioural measures for droplet-borne communicable disease, with their enabling and limiting factors at various implementation levels were evaluated. Sources of data: Keyword search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Medline, Science Direct, WHO and CDC online publication database. Using OCEBM as review criteria, 105 English-language articles, with ten bottom-up, non-pharmaceutical prevention measures, published between January 2000 and May 2020 were identified and examined. Areas of Agreement: Evidence-guided behavioural measures against COVID-19 transmission for global at-risk communities are identified. Area of Concern: Strong evidence-based systematic behavioural studies for COVID-19 prevention are lacking. Growing points: Very limited research publications are available for non-pharmaceutical interventions to facilitate pandemic response. Areas timely for research: Research with strong implementation feasibility that targets resource-poor settings with low baseline Health-EDRM capacity is urgently need.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily Ying Yang Chan","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tayyab Salim Shahzada","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Sze Tung Sham","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Caroline Dubois","author_inst":"GX Foundation, Hong Kong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhe Huang","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Sida Liu","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Janice Ying-en Ho","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Kevin KC Hung","author_inst":"Accident & Emergency Medicine Academic Unit, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ryoma Kayano","author_inst":"WHO Centre for Health Development, Kobe, Japan"},{"author_name":"Rajib Shaw","author_inst":"Keio University, Japan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20116921","rel_title":"Time courses of COVID-19 infection and local variation in socioeconomic and health disparities in England","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20116921","rel_abs":"Objective: To identify factors associated with local variation in the time course of COVID-19 case burden in England. Methods: We analyzed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data for 150 upper tier local authorities, from the period from January 30 to May 6, 2020, as reported by Public Health England. Using methods suitable for time-series data, we identified clusters of local authorities with distinct trajectories of daily cases, after adjusting for population size. We then tested for differences in sociodemographic, economic, and health disparity factors between these clusters. Results: Two clusters of local authorities were identified: a higher case trajectory that rose faster over time to reach higher peak infection levels, and a lower case trajectory cluster that emerged more slowly, and had a lower peak. The higher case trajectory cluster (79 local authorities) had higher population density (p<0.001), higher proportion of Black and Asian residents (p=0.03; p=0.02), higher multiple deprivation scores (p<0.001), a lower proportions of older adults (p=0.005), and higher preventable mortality rates (p=0.03). Local authorities with higher proportions of Black residents were more likely to belong to the high case trajectory cluster, even after adjusting for population density, deprivation, proportion of older adults and preventable mortality (p=0.04). Conclusion: Areas belonging to the trajectory with significantly higher COVID-19 case burden were more deprived, and had higher proportions of ethnic minority residents. A higher proportion of Black residents in regions belonging to the high trajectory cluster was not fully explained by differences in population density, deprivation, and other overall health disparities between the clusters.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelley H.

But profiles of loneliness during the pandemic and risk factors remain unclear. Data from 35,712 UK adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the pandemic) were analysed from 21\/03\/2020-03\/05\/2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify the latent classes of loneliness growth trajectories and their predictors. Analyses revealed four classes, with the baseline loneliness level ranging from low to high. In the first six weeks of lockdown, loneliness levels increased in the highest loneliness group, decreased in the lowest loneliness group, and stayed relatively constant in the middle two groups. Younger adults (OR=2.17-6.81), women (OR=1.59), people with low income (OR=1.3), the economically inactive (OR=1.3-2.04) and people with mental health conditions (OR=5.32) were more likely to be in highest loneliness class relative to the lowest. Further, living with others or in a rural area, and having more close friends or greater social support were protective. Perceived levels of loneliness in the first few weeks of lockdown during COVID-19 were relatively stable in the UK, but for many people these levels were high with no signs of improvement. Results suggest that more efforts are needed to address loneliness, especially amongst young people.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Agnes Norbury","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zhe Huang","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Sida Liu","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Janice Ying-en Ho","author_inst":"Collaborating Centre for Oxford University and CUHK for Disaster and Medical Humanitarian Response (CCOUC), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Chin"},{"author_name":"Kevin KC Hung","author_inst":"Accident & Emergency Medicine Academic Unit, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China"},{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ryoma Kayano","author_inst":"WHO Centre for Health Development, Kobe, Japan"},{"author_name":"Rajib Shaw","author_inst":"Keio University, Japan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.120410","rel_title":"Efficacy of a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit without RNA extraction and purification","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.120410","rel_abs":"Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventing the spread of the virus.

Materials and methods A systematic search of PubMed\/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv was done for studies on cancer patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions were calculated for categorical variables. Odds ratio and forest plots were constructed for both primary and secondary outcomes. The random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity between studies. Results This systematic review of 31 studies and meta-analysis of 181,323 patients from 26 studies involving 23,736 cancer patients is the largest meta-analysis to the best of our knowledge assessing outcomes in cancer patients affected by COVID-19. Our meta-analysis shows that cancer patients with COVID-19 have a higher likelihood of death (odds ratio, OR 2.54), which was largely driven by mortality among patients in China. Cancer patients were more likely to be intubated, although ICU admission rates were not statistically significant. Among cancer subtypes, the mortality was highest in hematological malignancies (OR 2.43) followed by lung cancer (OR 1.8). There was no association between receipt of a particular type of oncologic therapy and mortality. Our study showed that cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are a decade older than the normal population and have a higher proportion of co-morbidities. There was insufficient data to assess the association of COVID-directed therapy and survival outcomes in cancer patients. Despite the heterogeneity of studies and inconsistencies in reported variables and outcomes, these data could guide clinical practice and oncologic care during this unprecedented global health pandemic. Conclusion Cancer patients with COVID-19 disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A more nuanced understanding of the interaction between cancer-directed therapies and COVID-19-directed therapies is needed. This will require uniform prospective recording of data, possibly in multi-institutional registry databases.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhanu Prasad Venkatesulu","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viveksandeep Thoguluva Chandrasekar","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Giridhar","author_inst":"All India Institute of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Pragati Advani","author_inst":"National cancer institue"},{"author_name":"Amrish Sharma","author_inst":"MD Anderson cancer centre"},{"author_name":"Cheng En Hsieh","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thiraviyam Elumalai","author_inst":"The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hagar I Elghazawy","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"},{"author_name":"Vivek Verma","author_inst":"Allegheny General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sunil Krishnan","author_inst":"Mayo clinic"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115139","rel_title":"Causal Impact of Masks, Policies, Behavior on Early Covid-19 Pandemic in the U.S.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115139","rel_abs":"This paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by US states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration people's voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks. Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees on April 1st could have reduced the growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April, and could have led to as much as 17 to 55 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 17 to 55 thousand saved lives. Our estimates imply that removing non-essential business closures (while maintaining school closures, restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants) could have led to -20 to 60 percent more cases and deaths by the end of May. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 25 to 170 percent, which implies that 0.5 to 3.4 million more Americans could have been infected if stay-at-home orders had not been implemented. Finally, not having implemented any policies could have led to at least a 7 fold increase with an uninformative upper bound in cases (and deaths) by the end of May in the US, with considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures, which had little cross-sectional variation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victor Chernozhukov","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Kasahara","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Paul Schrimpf","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Pragati Advani","author_inst":"National cancer institue"},{"author_name":"Amrish Sharma","author_inst":"MD Anderson cancer centre"},{"author_name":"Cheng En Hsieh","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thiraviyam Elumalai","author_inst":"The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hagar I Elghazawy","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"},{"author_name":"Vivek Verma","author_inst":"Allegheny General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sunil Krishnan","author_inst":"Mayo clinic"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115329","rel_title":"Did the National lockdown lock COVID-19 down in India, and reduce pressure on health infrastructure?","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115329","rel_abs":"Background & objectives: The spread of COVID19 in India has posed a major challenge for policy makers. Policy response in form of imposition of a prolonged national lockdown has imposed substantial costs on the entire population. But the extent to which it has contained the spread of the epidemic needs to be assessed. Methods: We use an Interrupted Time Series model to assess the success of lockdowns in containing COVID-19. In the second step, we use four variants of the SIR models to develop a counterfactual- what would have happened without the lockdown. These results are compared with actual data. The analysis is undertaken for India, and Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu. Results: Lockdown has reduced the number of COVID-19 cases by 23.65 to 337.73 lakh in Class I cities and towns, where COVID has mainly spread. It has averted about 0.01 to 0.10 lakh deaths. At the regional level, however, lockdown has averted a health crisis as existing ICU and ventilator facilities for critically ill patients would have been inadequate. Interpretation & conclusions: Overall, the results for three of the four models reveal that lockdown has a modest impact on spread of COVID-19; the health infrastructure at the national level is not over strained, even at the peak. At the regional level, on the other hand, lockdowns may have been justified. However, given that identification of new cases is limited by levels of daily testing that are low even by Asian standards, analysis based upon official data may have limitations and result in flawed decisions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zakir Husain","author_inst":"Presidency University"},{"author_name":"Arup Kumar Das","author_inst":"LEHS|WISH Foundation, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saswata Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Development Studies Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Pragati Advani","author_inst":"National cancer institue"},{"author_name":"Amrish Sharma","author_inst":"MD Anderson cancer centre"},{"author_name":"Cheng En Hsieh","author_inst":"Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thiraviyam Elumalai","author_inst":"The Christie NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hagar I Elghazawy","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University"},{"author_name":"Vivek Verma","author_inst":"Allegheny General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sunil Krishnan","author_inst":"Mayo clinic"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115378","rel_title":"Older age is associated with sustained detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115378","rel_abs":"PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples is used for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and for determining timing of discharge.

We introduce the concept of 'accessible population for transmission of the disease', which can be a small fraction of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force. This assumption, together with the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible population' assumption and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the total number of infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast further progression of the disease. The approach further helps us to analyze the original model equations. We show that the original model equations provide a very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of infections. The active infected population of the model is seen to exhibit a turning point around mid-May, suggesting the beginning of a slow-down in the spread of infections. However, the rate of slowing down beyond the turning point is small and therefore the cumulative number of infections is likely to saturate to about 3.8 x 105 only towards the end of July or beginning of August, provided the lock-down conditions continue to prevail. Noting that the fits obtained from the reduced logistic equation and the full model equations are equally good, the underlying causes for the limited forecasting ability of the reduced logistic equation is elucidated. The model and the procedure adopted here are expected to be useful in fitting the data for other countries and forecasting the progression of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Garani Ananthakrishna","author_inst":"Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru 560012, India"},{"author_name":"Jagadish Kumar","author_inst":"Utkal University"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Morinaga","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Kamada","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Sho Nakakubo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yu Yamashita","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yasuo Shichinohe","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Nasuhara","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Safety Management, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of medicine"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20111955","rel_title":"Age separation dramatically reduces COVID-19 mortality rate in a computational model of a large population","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20111955","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global lock down in many countries throughout the world. Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep economy going on one hand, yet keep the population safe on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here we use a network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is known about the virus, to explore 5 different scenarios of partial lock down release. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between age groups, protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group, still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by 66%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. We therefore propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections but still strong protection for the older population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liron Mizrahi","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Shani Stern","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Morinaga","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Kamada","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Sho Nakakubo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yu Yamashita","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yasuo Shichinohe","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Nasuhara","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Safety Management, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of medicine"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115212","rel_title":"Monitoring and forecasting the number of reported and unreported cases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil using Particle Filter","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115212","rel_abs":"In this paper, we combine algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter (PF) with SIRU-type epidemic model to monitor and forecast cases of Covid-19 in Brazil from February up to September.

To aid in this effort, we develop a risk calculator for COVID-19 mortality based on various socio-demographic factors and pre-existing conditions for the US adult population by combining information from the UK-based OpenSAFELY study, with mortality rates by age and ethnicity available across US states. We tailor the tool to produce absolute risks for individuals in future time frames by incorporating information on pandemic dynamics at the community level as available from forecasting models. We apply this risk calculation model to available data on prevalence and co-occurrences of the risk-factors from a variety of data sources to project risk for the general adult population across 477 US cities (defined as Census Places) and for the 65 years and older Medicare population across 3,113 US counties, respectively. Validation analyses based on these projected risks and data on tens of thousands of recent deaths show that the model is well calibrated for the US population. Projections show that the model can identify relatively small fractions of the population (e.g. 4.3%) which will lead to a disproportionately large number of deaths (e.g. 49.8%), and thus will be useful for effectively targeting individuals for early vaccinations, but there will be wide variation in risk distribution across US communities. We provide a web-based tool for individualized risk calculations and interactive maps for viewing the city-, county- and state-level risk projections.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Jin","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Neha Agarwala","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County"},{"author_name":"Prosenjit Kundu","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Harvey","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Yuqi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Wallace","author_inst":"PolicyMap Corp"},{"author_name":"Nilanjan Chatterjee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Nasuhara","author_inst":"Division of Hospital Safety Management, Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of medicine"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20107656","rel_title":"The expediency of local modelling to aid national responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20107656","rel_abs":"Background: With the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gripping most of the globe, healthcare and economic recovery strategies are being explored currently as a matter of urgency. Methods: We adopted the epidemiological model which informs United Kingdom government's national policy on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and used it in a local context and show how projections in terms of presentations of symptomatic patients in a variety of settings differ depending on local demographics. Setting: England, United Kingdom, population level modelled 3.2m Results: We clearly demonstrate that there is significant difference in the way the modelling behaves in terms of potential subsequent waves for levels of demand on the health and care systems. This provides evidence of differing timeline of peak demands and clearly shows varying levels of demand throughout the four modelled sub-geographies. Conclusions: The study results clearly outline the expediency of national modelling being adopted to reflect local health and care systems. We urge readers to ensure that any national policy is appropriately adopted to suit local health and care systems. In addition, we share our methodology to ensure other professionals could replicate this study elsewhere. Background National governments are forced to take urgent action with national policy restricting social interactions and businesses to temporarily close. In order to fully understand how the limited health and care resources could be targeted in response to this pandemic, we need to create a thorough understanding of the impact of national policy on local health and care systems. The guiding principle and understanding here is that health and care services are provided locally not nationally, not in aggregate but to individuals. Therefore, we conducted a study using existing models which are used to inform national policy and adapted these to consider local nuances to see whether such projective model would behave differently; showing how projections in terms of presentations of symptomatic patients in a variety of settings differ depending on local demographics.

We used a snowball sampling technique starting from known professional and social media groups and individuals and then was distributed on various internet platforms. The survey instrument was based on HBM constructs. Results Some 877 individuals participated in the survey with a mean age of 37.8 more males mostly having a university education employed and residing in Khartoum. More than half of the participants scored high in almost all Health Belief Model constructs except for benefits of hand hygiene. The findings show that the HBM constructs are correlated to each other as well as to other socio-demographic factors. Self-efficacy correlated negatively with susceptibility while positively with severity benefits of and barriers to hand hygiene, benefits and barriers to social distancing respectively. Conclusion The findings show that the HBM constructs are correlated to each other as well as to other socio-demographic factors. Self-efficacy must be taken into account as a strong changing factor to susceptibility and severity perceptions.

In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents.

The genetic variation of ACE2 function and expression across populations is still poorly understood. This study aims at better understanding the genetic basis of COVID-19 outcomes by studying association between genetic variation in ACE2 and disease severity in the Iranian population. Methods: We analyzed two large Iranian cohorts and several publicly available human population variant databases to identify novel and previously known ACE2 exonic variants present in the Iranian population and considered those as candidate variants for association between genetic variation and disease severity. We genotyped these variants across three groups of COVID-19 patients with different clinical outcomes (mild disease, severe disease, and death) and evaluated this genetic variation with regard to clinical outcomes. Results: We identified 32 exonic variants present in Iranian cohorts or other public variant databases. Among those, 11 variants are novel and have thus not been described in other populations previously. Following genotyping of these 32 candidate variants, only the synonymous polymorphism (c.2247G>A) was detected across the three groups of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Genetic variability of known and novel exonic variants was low among our COVID-19 patients. Our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that exonic variation in ACE2 has a sizeable impact on COVID-19 severity across the Iranian population.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Ardeshirdavani","author_inst":"Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), STADIUS Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Pooya Zakeri","author_inst":"Centre for Brain and Disease Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Leuven, Belgium.

Each patient had [&ge;]15 days of follow-up. Among 26 patients, the median age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43 to 62), 65% were men, and 77% were Latinx. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for 11 (42%) patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and 20 patients (77%) overall. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20). Patients were managed with lung protective ventilation (tidal volume <8 ml\/kg of ideal body weight and plateau pressure [&le;]30 cmH2O on 98% and 78% of ventilator days, respectively).

of novel coronavirus has raised concerns about nosocomial transmission; that is, transmission within healthcare settings. Research from previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases suggests a major cause of nosocomial transmission is healthcare professionals' poor compliance with recommended personal protective behaviours. This rapid evidence review explored existing literature on emerging infectious disease outbreaks to identify factors associated with compliance with social and behavioural infection control measures among healthcare staff. 56 papers were reviewed and several positive associations were found: Staff working in emergency or intensive care settings appeared more likely to comply with recommendations than those in other settings, and there was some evidence that contact with confirmed cases could improve compliance. There was some evidence that staff with higher levels of anxiety and higher concern about the risk of infection were more likely to comply with recommended behaviour, and that monitoring from superiors could improve compliance. Several negative associations were also found. Observed non-compliance of colleagues could hinder compliance. Staff identified many barriers to compliance related to personal protective equipment, including availability; perceived difficulty and effectiveness; inconvenience; discomfort; and a negative impact on patient care. There appeared to be many issues regarding the communication and ease of understanding of infection control guidance. Based on the results of this review we recommend provision of training and education tailored for different occupational roles within the healthcare setting; managerial staff 'leading by example'; ensuring adequate resources for infection control; and timely provision of practical evidence-based infection control guidelines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha K Brooks","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Greenberg","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114272","rel_title":"How did governmental interventions affect the spread of COVID-19 in European countries?","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114272","rel_abs":"Background To reduce transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019, European governments have implemented successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. Methods Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures. Results The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0{middle dot}29), Spain (0{middle dot}24), and Germany (0{middle dot}27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0{middle dot}34), Belgium (0{middle dot}35) and the UK (0{middle dot}37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0{middle dot}45). Interpretation There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Andries Jacobus Post","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marta Regis","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhuozhao Zhan","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Edwin R van den Heuvel","author_inst":"Eindhoven Unversity of Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113019","rel_title":"Modelling Capacity on London Underground Carriages in Light of UK Government Mandated Social Distancing Rules in Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113019","rel_abs":"The UK has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and London in particular has experienced a large number of cases.

Drug repurposing has played a key part in this response. The rapid increase in trial activity has raised questions about efficiency and lack of coordination. Our objective was to develop a user-friendly, open access database to monitor and rapidly identify trials of medicinal products. Methods: Using the US clinicaltrials.gov (NCT) registry, the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), we identified all COVID-19 trials of medicinal products. Trials that were out of scope and duplicates were excluded. A manual encoding was performed to ascertain key information (e.g. trial aim, type of intervention etc). The database, Covid19db, is published online at: http:\/\/www.redo-project.org\/covid19db\/. Results: Descriptive statistics of the database from April 4th 2020 through to August 18th show an increase from 186 to 1618 trials, or an average of 10.5 new trials registered per day. Over this period, the proportion of trials including a repurposing arm decreased slightly (from a maximum of 75% to 64% at the end of the covered period) as did the proportion of trials aiming to prevent infection (from a maximum of 16% to 13%). The most popular trial intervention is hydroxychloroquine (212 trials), followed by azithromycin (64 trials), tocilizumab, favipiravir and chloroquine (145 trials). Total planned enrolment is 1064556 participants as of 18th August 2020. Conclusions: we have developed an open access and regularly updated tool to monitor clinical trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat infection by SARS-CoV-2 globally. Our analysis shows a high number of 'me-too' trials, in particular for some repurposed drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab, substantiating calls for better coordination and better use of trial resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pan Pantziarka","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Liese Vandeborne","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Lydie Meheus","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Gauthier Bouche","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114983","rel_title":"A call for governments to pause Twitter censorship: a cross-sectional study using Twitter data as social-spatial sensors of COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 research diffusion","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114983","rel_abs":"Objectives: To determine whether Twitter data can be used as social-spatial sensors to show how research on COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 diffuses through the population to reach the people that are especially affected by the disease. Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis conducted between 23rd March and 14th April 2020. Setting: Three sources of data were used in the analysis: (1) deaths per number of population for COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from Coronavirus Resource Center at John Hopkins University and Worldometer, (2) publications related to COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from WHO COVID-19 database of global publications, and (3) tweets of these publications retrieved from Altmetric.com and Twitter. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): To map Twitter activity against number of publications and deaths per number of population worldwide and in the USA states. To determine the relationship between number of tweets as dependent variable and deaths per number of population and number of publications as independent variables. Results: Deaths per one hundred thousand population for countries ranged from 0 to 104, and deaths per one million population for USA states ranged from 2 to 513. Total number of publications used in the analysis was 1761, and total number of tweets used in the analysis was 751,068. Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Poisson regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding the country's number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p<0.001). Conversely, this relationship was negatively correlated in USA states (coefficient -0.0013, S.E. 0.0001, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study shows that Twitter can play a crucial role in the rapid research response during the COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, especially to spread research with prompt public scrutiny. Governments are urged to pause censorship of social media platforms during these unprecedented times to support the scientific community's fight against COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanash Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robin Haunschild","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research"},{"author_name":"Lutz Bornmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Society"},{"author_name":"George Garas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114694","rel_title":"The association between treatment with heparin and survival in patients with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114694","rel_abs":"Objectives: This study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19. Methods: Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. Results: At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR: 0.54(0.36-0.82) p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42 (0.26-0.66) p<0.001. Conclusions: The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community.

Identifying biologic markers associated with prognosis can help clinicians recognize disease severity. Objective: To describe the association between D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, LDH, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated on the inpatient medical service at a university hospital in Washington, DC. Design: In this retrospective study, we included all adults admitted to the inpatient medicine service at George Washington University Hospital between March 12, 2020 and May 9, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors not requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring intubation, and non-survivors. Key Results: 299 patients were included in our study, of whom 69 required transfer to the ICU, 39 required intubation, and 71 died. Threshold values for IL-6 (>50 pg\/mL), D-dimer (>3 mcg\/mL), ferritin (>450 ng\/mL), CRP (>100 mg\/L), and LDH (1,200 u\/L) were found to be statistically significant and independently associated with higher odd of clinical deterioration and death. Hypertension, CVA and heart disease independently had an increased risk of all three outcomes, while CKD had only an increased risk of death. Patient co-morbidities had no effect on the different biomarkers' significant association with poor patient clinical outcomes, except cancer.

Very high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and substantial disease severity caused medical care capacity shortage in many countries. Therefore, real-time epidemic forecasting of the COVID-19 is useful to plan public health strategies like country lockdown and healthcare reorganization. We used extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Poland under different scenarios of the lockdown and lockdown removal. We used time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4 to May 22 2020. Our forecast includes the impact of a timeline of preventive measures introduced in Poland. Using eSIR algorithm we estimated the basic reproductive number and a total number of infections under different epidemic trend scenarios. Using eSIR modeling we estimated that the basic reproductive number in Poland concerning different scenarios of the lockdown removal is in a range of 3.91-4.79. The lowest predicted number of infected cases would be 263 900 (0 - 1 734 200, 95%CI) if the strict protective measures were maintained until the end of September. However, under different scenarios of precautions removal, a total number of infected cases may exceed one million within the next year. Relatively early introduction of strong precautions in Poland significantly slowed down epidemic spread in Poland in comparison with other European countries like Italy or Spain. However, early removal of protective measures may result in a significant increase in infection. Data shows that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Poland beyond May 18 is linear what could be a prognosis of a duration of the epidemic exceeding 300 days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Magdalena Orzechowska","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz, Poland"},{"author_name":"Andrzej K.

Methods: New models constructed showing the relationship of the I(prime) (the number of infected individuals divided by the total population of a city) with the independent variables -time, temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity. The regression models fitting in the data were statistically validated by : 1) plot of observed and predicted response; 2) standardized residual plots showing the characteristics of errors; 3) adjusted R^2 value; 4) the p value for the parameters associated with the various independent variables; and 5) the predictive power of the model beyond data points. Results: Models indicate that 1) the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher relative humidity conditions; 2) disease transmission is expected to be reduced more with higher wind velocity; 3) the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases increases in one model with a constant rate and in the other two with varying rates in time. These transmission features seem to have connections with the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Under suitable meteorological conditions, the partial natural disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic could be possible.

Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies, but US data are lacking, in part because societal closure complicates study conduct. Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Design: Statewide cross-sectional seroprevalence study, conducted April 19-28, 2020. Setting: Grocery stores (n=99) located in 26 counties throughout NYS, which were essential businesses that remained open during a period of societal closure and attract a heterogenous clientele. Participants: Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer. Exposures: Region (New York City, Westchester\/Rockland, Long Island, Rest of New York State), age, sex, race and ethnicity. Main Outcomes: Primary outcome: cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on dry-blood spot (DBS) SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity; secondary outcome: percent of infections diagnosed. Results: Among 15,101 adults with suitable DBS specimens, 1,887 (12.5%) were reactive using a validated SARS-CoV-2 IgG microsphere immunoassay (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 99.75%). Following post-stratification weighting on region, sex, age, and race and ethnicity and adjustment for assay characteristics, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was higher among Hispanic\/Latino (29.2%, 95% CI: 27.2-31.2%), non-Hispanic black\/African American (20.2% 95% CI, 18.1-22.3%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%, 95% CI: 9.4-15.4%) adults than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.7%, p<.0001). Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%-24.0).
