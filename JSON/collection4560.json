Methods: Clinical data of common COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shanghai public health clinical center for treatment from January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A retrospective study was conducted and the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they used proton pump inhibitors or not. The differences in SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital stay between the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 common cases were included in this study, including 80 males (51.9%), 35 patients (22.7%) in the proton pump inhibitors group, and 119 patients (77.3%) in the control group. In the proton pump inhibitors group and the control group, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 7(6-9) and 7(6-11) days, and the duration of hospital stay was 21(16-25) and 20(15-26) days, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the cumulative incidence of discharge, and the same after Propensity Score Match, all P > 0.05. Multivariate analysis suggested that chronic gastropathy prolonged the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, the HR was 20.924(3.547-123.447). Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease and malignant tumor all increased the duration of hospital stay for COVID-19, and the HR were 1.820 (1.073-3.085), 4.370 (1.205-15.844), 9.011 (2.681-30.290) and 5.270 (1.237-22.456), respectively; the duration of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was shortened by SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and the HR was 0.907 (0.869-0.947); all P < 0.05. Conclusion: Proton pump inhibitors use have no effect on the prolonging or shortening of the course of adults hospitalized with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bing Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Ping Qian","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Liang Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.07.20124677","rel_title":"Repurposing of drugs for Covid-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.07.20124677","rel_abs":"Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the data currently available regarding the repurposing of different drugs for Covid-19 treatment. Participants with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 will be included. The interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed, and comparators will include standard of care treatment or placebo. Methods: We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US (ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 2020. All studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs were included. Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study quality. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol is available at PROSPERO (CRD42020180915). Results: From 708 identified studies or clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case reports met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321 patients) and 3 case series (191 patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge rate compared to 50% with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown no significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which is also seen in our meta-analysis (p=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a significant difference compared to the control group (p=0.001). Lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our meta-analyses (p=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power. Discussion: Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events.

This immediate clinical driver, combined with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2 measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring, and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites, with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude, and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and everyday-life settings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harry J Davies","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian Williams","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danilo P Mandic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiao-long Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-liang Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan-ling Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Da-wei Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China"},{"author_name":"Jun-biao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Tian-lei Ying","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125153","rel_title":"Evidence for ethnic inequalities in mortality related to COVID-19 infections: Findings from an ecological analysis of England and Wales","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125153","rel_abs":"Background In the absence of direct data on ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 related mortality in the UK, we examine the relationship between ethnic composition of an area and rate of mortality in the area. Methods Ecological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. Results For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5.10 (3.99 to 6.21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people. Discussion We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities, including among key workers, driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Nazroo","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Laia Becares","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danilo P Mandic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiao-long Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-liang Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan-ling Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Da-wei Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China"},{"author_name":"Jun-biao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Tian-lei Ying","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125393","rel_title":"Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125393","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made government and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using non-pharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number was computed with and without interventions and was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population, while the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to the virus to the barest minimum.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chinwendu Emilian Madubueze","author_inst":"University of Agriculture, Makurdi"},{"author_name":"Dachollom Sambo","author_inst":"Akanu  Ibiam  Federal  Polytechnic, Unwana, P.M.B.  1007  Afikpo,  Ebonyi State,  Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Isaac O.

This research presents a mathematical model to empirically assess measures related to various pandemic containment strategies, their similarities and a probabilistic estimate on the evolution of Covid-19 incidence rates. The model is built on the principle that, the exponential rise and decay of the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections can be construed as a set of concurrent non-linear waves. These waves can be characterized by a linear combination of Gaussian and Cauchy Lorentz functions collectively termed as Gaussian-Lorentzian Composite (GLC) function. The GLC function is used for non-linear approximation of officially confirmed Covid-19 incidence rates in each country. Results of fitting GLC based models to incidence rate trends of 20 different countries proves that the models can empirically explain the growth and decay trajectory Covid-19 infections in a given population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radhakrishnan Poomari","author_inst":"Xformics Inc"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Ma","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Kun Sun","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Yuxue Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiao Wang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Tingyu Kuo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 [&ge;]50%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2% versus 15.0%, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07). After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Cepelowicz Rajter","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Sherman","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Naaz Fatteh","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fabio Vogel","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jamie Sacks","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jean-Jacques Rajter","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Yuxue Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiao Wang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Tingyu Kuo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Several clinical studies have provided evidence for the antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in patients with respiratory coronaviruses. This study assessed the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha 2b in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first month after the outbreak began in Cuba. Method This multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 16 hospitals in 8 Cuban provinces. Participants were patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection detected from throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol, that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir\/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-alpha 2b (Heberon Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and non-detectable virus by RT-PCR). The secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. Results From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 761 (93.4%) were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 53 received the approved protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs 26.1%, p<0.01). The CFR for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-alpha 2b the CFR was reduce to 0.92. The estimated global CFR is 6.34% and 4.05% for the Americas reported by WHO and PAHO, respectively. In this study, 82 patients (10.1%) required intensive care and, of these, 42 (5.5%) were treated with IFN. Conclusions This report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Pereda","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

Nevertheless, there have been no attempts at modelling it at high spatial resolution, needed to understand geographical differences in the mortality patterns, to evaluate temporal lags and to plan for future waves of the pandemic. Methods This is the first subnational study on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the third most-hit country. We considered municipality level and estimated all-cause mortality weekly trends based on the first four months of 2016 -- 2019. We specified a Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for spatial heterogeneity as well as for non-linear smooth spatio-temporal terms. We predicted the weekly mortality rates at municipality level for 2020 based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends (i.e.~in the absence of the pandemic) and estimated the excess mortality and the uncertainty surrounding it. Results There was strong evidence of excess mortality for Northern Italy; Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed higher mortality from the beginning of March, with 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. After discounting for the number of COVID-19-confirmed deaths, Lombardia still registered 10,197 (9,264 to 11,037) excess deaths, while regions in the North-West and North-East had 2,572 (1,772 to 3,297) and 2,047 (1,075 to 3,058) extra deaths, respectively. We observed marked geographical differences at municipality level. The city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%) at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Blangiardo","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michela Cameletti","author_inst":"University of Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Monica Pirani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gianni Corsetti","author_inst":"Italian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Marco Battaglini","author_inst":"Italian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Baio","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Natacha Mezquia","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

We adopted early CPAP and self-proning, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of this approach. Methods This retrospective observational study included all patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR, and negative patients with high clinical suspicion. Our protocol advised early CPAP and self-proning for severe cases, aiming to prevent rather than respond to deterioration. CPAP was provided outside ICU by ward staff supported by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. Data were analysed descriptively and compared against a large UK cohort (ISARIC). Results 559 patients admitted before 1\/May\/20 were included. 365 were discharged alive, 182 died, and 12 remain inpatient. 165 patients (29.5%) received CPAP, 40 (7.2%) were admitted to ICU and 27 (4.8%) were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 33.3%, ICU mortality 54.5%. Following CPAP 64% of patients with moderate or severe ARDS, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation. Figures for ICU admission, intubation and hospital mortality are lower than those from ISARIC, whilst ICU mortality is similar. Following ISARIC proportions we would have admitted 92 patients to ICU and intubated 55. Using the described protocol, we intubated 27 patients from 40 admissions, and remained within our expanded ICU capacity. Conclusion Bradford's protocol produced good results despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes. In particular we avoided overloading ICU capacity. We advocate this approach as both effective and safe.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Lawton","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kate M Wilkinson","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Aaron Corp","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabeia Javid","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura MacNally","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael McCooe","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

This paper examines four demographic and clinical factors (age, time to hospital, presence of chronic disease, and sex) and utilizes Shapley values from coalitional game theory and machine learning to evaluate their relative importance in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The analyses suggest that out of the 4 factors studied, age is the most important in predicting COVID-19 mortality, followed by time to hospital. Sex and presence of chronic disease were both found to be relatively unimportant, and the two global interpretation techniques differed in ranking them. Additionally, this paper creates partial dependence plots to determine and visualize the marginal effect of each factor on COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates how local interpretation of COVID-19 mortality prediction can be applicable in a clinical setting. Lastly, this paper derives clinically applicable decision rules about mortality probabilities through a parsimonious 3-split surrogate tree, demonstrating that high-accuracy COVID-19 mortality prediction can be achieved with simple, interpretable models.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Russell Yang","author_inst":"The Harker School"},{"author_name":"Kate M Wilkinson","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Aaron Corp","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabeia Javid","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura MacNally","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael McCooe","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 26 June 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. Findings: A total of 54 study reports for 49 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 0.4% and 64.0% among staff at affected facilities. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 17.1% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies of outbreaks, no LTC staff members had died. Studies of wider LTC populations found that between 0.4% and 40.8% of users, and between 4.0% and 23.8% of staff were infected, although the generalisability of these studies is limited. There was limited information on the impact of COVID-19 on LTC in the community. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian Salcher-Konrad","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Arnoupe Jhass","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Huseyin Naci","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Marselia Tan","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Yousef El-Tawil","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Adelina Comas-Herrera","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal\/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score > 4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.7) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.6) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusions: We found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct costumer exposure were 5 times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while cigarette smokers were 90% less likely to have positive assays. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Harvard University T.H.

As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Wen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Liwei Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Huan He","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sijia Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sunyang Fu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sunghwan Sohn","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacob A Kugel","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vinod C Kaggal","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ming Huang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yanshan Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feichen Shen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jungwei Fan","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Hongfang Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many fatalities and forced scientific communities to foster their Research and Development (R & D) activities. As a result, there is an enormous growth of scholarly literature on the subject. In order to combat this novel coronavirus, the open access to scientific literature is essential. On this line, many reputed academic institutions and publication firms have made their literature on COVID-19 accessible to all. By maintaining the database of updated information on global literature on Coronavirus disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) is playing a pivotal role. The present study analyzed 89 Indian publications on SARS-CoV-2 accessible through WHO COVID-19 database. The research data was restricted for the period of 2\/3\/2020 to 12\/5\/2020. The analysis was carried out in light of the objectives of the study. The study found the considerable and constant growth of Indian publications on COVID-19 from mid-April. It is interesting to note that the prolific authors belong to either AIIMS or ICMR institutes. Majority of the COVID-19 articles were found to be collaborative publications. The study noticed that no research publications on COVID-19 have appeared from North Eastern region. Regarding the research output on COVID-19, the performance of largest states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar was found to be poor. Delhi state contributed highest publications on COVID-19. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi was the most productive institution in terms of publications. It is also important to note that the central government undertakings like AIIMS and ICMR, New Delhi and its affiliated institutions shared largest proportion of publications on COVID-19. The Indian Journal of Medical Research has emerged as the productive journal contributing highest number of the publications. The highest contribution in COVID-19 research takes the form of journal articles. In terms of research area, the majority of the publications were related to Epidemiology. The study reported covid, coronavirus, India, pandemic, sars etc. as the frequently occurred keywords in the COVID-19 publications. The highly cited publications were of evidenced based studies. It is observed that the studies pertaining to virology, diagnosis and treatment, clinical features etc. have received highest citations than general studies on epidemiology or pandemic","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"N Vasantha Raju","author_inst":"Government First Grade College, Talakadu"},{"author_name":"S.B.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimise the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on wide-spread adoption. We aimed to identify the proportion of people who had downloaded the Australian Government COVIDSafe app and examine the reasons why some did not. Method: An online national survey with representative quotas for age and gender was conducted between May 8 and May 11 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a healthcare professional or had been tested for COVID-19. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Of survey participants, 37% had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 19% intended to, 28% refused, and 16% were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (25%) and technical concerns (24%). Other reasons included a belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app is unnecessary (16%), distrust in the Government (11%), and apathy (11%). In addition, COVIDSafe knowledge varied with confusion about its purpose and capabilities. Conclusion: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of its citizens, specifically in regards to privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives such as download and correct use.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rae Thomas","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Zoe Michaleff","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwood","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Eman Abukmail","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Sunghwan Sohn","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacob A Kugel","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vinod C Kaggal","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ming Huang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yanshan Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feichen Shen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jungwei Fan","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Hongfang Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Objectives: To estimate the effect of the two-stage strong social distancing measures, the closure of all non-essential shopping centers and businesses on March 16 and the shelter in place orders (SIPOs) on March 23 on the COVID-19 growth rate in Greece Methods: We obtained data on COVID-19 cases in Greece from February 26th through May 4th from publicly available sources. An interrupted time-series regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the measures on the exponential growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases, controlling for the number of daily testing, and weekly fixed-effects. Results: The growth rate of the COVID-19 cases in the pre-policies implementation period was positive as expected (p=0.003). Based on the estimates of the interrupted time-series, our results indicate that the SIPO on March 23 significantly slowed the growth rate of COVID-19 in Greece (p=0.04). However, we did not find evidence on the effectiveness of standalone and partial measures such as the non-essential business closures implemented on March 16 on the COVID-19 spread reduction. Discussion: The combined social distancing measures implemented by the Greek authorities within the first few weeks after the first confirmed case of the virus reduced the COVID-19 growth rate. These findings provide evidence and highlight the effectiveness of these measures to flatten the curve and to slow the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodoros Giannouchos","author_inst":"Pharmacotherapy Outcomes Research Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA"},{"author_name":"Aris Giannouchos","author_inst":"St. Vinzenz Hospital, Dusseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ilias Christodoulou","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Steletou","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Regional General University Hospital of Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Kyriakos Souliotis","author_inst":"Department of Social and Education Policy, University of Peloponnese, Corinth, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sunghwan Sohn","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacob A Kugel","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vinod C Kaggal","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ming Huang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yanshan Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feichen Shen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jungwei Fan","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Hongfang Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

In this study we aim to investigate the practice of casual sex and the factors that are associated with this event in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey carried out throughout Brazil and Portugal in April 2020, during the period of social isolation, with a sample of 2361 MSM. The collection took place in meeting apps and Facebook. Findings: There was a high frequency of casual sex (53%) and the use of strategies, without technical or scientific basis, to prevent infection by SARSCoV-2, such as the use of Truvada (12.7%). Among the factors that increased the chance of engaging in casual sex, we highlight: having sex simultaneously with two or more people (aOR = 2.1; 95%CI 1.4 - 3.4); Having sex with a regular and casual partner (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 0.9-2.8), and only with casual (aOR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.8 - 3.5), using Facebook (aOR = 4.6; 95%CI 3.0-7.2), and cruising, swing houses, saunas or cruising points to get partners (aOR = 5.4; 95%CI 3.2 -8.9), being HIV positive (ORa = 11.7; 95%CI 4.7-29.2), or of unknown serological status (aOR = 1.4; 95%CI 0.7-2.3). In both countries, the longer the period of social isolation, the greater the chance of engaging in casual sex. Interpretation: Despite the great differences between the two countries, in both of them we registered a significant frequency of practicing casual sex, accompanied by dubious strategies to minimize the risk of acquiring SARSCov-2. This indicates that MSM participating in the research, to some degree, continue to be exposed to risky sexual practices for HIV infection and other STIs, but also for COVID-19.

Respiratory decline in COVID-19 is mediated by a pneumonic aberrant immune cytokine storm. Low-dose radiation was used to treat pneumonia in the pre-antibiotic era. Radiation immunomodulatory effects may improve outcomes in COVID-19. Methods: We performed a single-institution phase I\/II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of single-fraction, low-dose, whole-lung radiation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were hospitalized, had radiographic pneumonic infiltrates, required supplemental oxygen, and were clinically deteriorating. Results: Of nine patients screened, five were treated with whole-lung radiation from April 23-28, 2020 and followed for 7 days. Median age was 90 (range 64-94); four were nursing home residents with multiple comorbidities. Within 24 hours of radiation, three patients (60%) weaned from supplemental oxygen to ambient air, four (80%) exhibited radiographic improvement, and median Glasgow coma score improved from 10 to 14. A fourth patient (80% overall recovery) weaned from oxygen at hour 96. Mean time to clinical recovery was 35 hours. There were no acute skin, pulmonary, GI, GU toxicities. Conclusions: In a pilot trial of five oxygen-dependent patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, low-dose whole-lung radiation led to rapid improvement in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic infiltrates without acute toxicity. Low-dose whole-lung radiation is safe, shows early promise of efficacy, and warrants further study in larger prospective trials.

We present a detailed overview of the clinical validation and implementation of the first laboratory-developed real-time reverse-transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) test offered in the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital system following the emergency use authority (EUA) guidance issued by the US Food and Drug Administration. Validation was performed on nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens (n=124) using newly designed dual-target rRT-PCR (altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Reagent) for detecting of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract specimens, including bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirates. Accuracy testing demonstrated excellent assay agreement between expected and observed values. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2.7 and 23.0 gene copies\/reaction for nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, respectively. Retrospective analysis of 1,694 tests from 1,571 patients revealed increased positivity in older patients and males compared to females, and an increasing positivity rate from approximately 20% at the start of testing to 50% at the end of testing three weeks later. Our findings demonstrate that the assay accurately and sensitively identifies SARS-CoV-2 in multiple specimen types in the clinical setting and summarizes clinical data from early in the epidemic in New York City.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priya Velu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arryn Craney","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Phyllis Ruggiero","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"John Sipley","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lin Cong","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erika Hissong","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Massimo Loda","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cushing","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hanna Rennert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jungwei Fan","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Hongfang Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Objective: To evaluate the association between ACEIs or ARBs use and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources: Systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to May 31, 2020. We also searched the preprint servers medRxiv and SSNR for additional studies. Study Selection: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of ACEIs or ARBs use on clinical outcomes of adult patients with COVID-19. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Risk of bias of observational studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects models and effects expressed as Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences with their 95% confidence interval (95%CI). If available, adjusted effects were pooled. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were COVID-19 severity, hospital discharge, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and troponin, creatinine, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and D-dimer levels. Results: 40 studies (21 cross-sectional, two case-control, and 17 cohorts) involving 50615 patients were included. ACEIs or ARBs use was not associated with all-cause mortality overall (OR 1.11, 95%CI 0.77-1.60, p=0.56), in subgroups by study design and using adjusted effects. ACEI or ARB use was independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity (aOR 0.56, 95%CI 0.37-0.87, p<0.01). No significant associations were found between ACEIs or ARBs use and hospital discharge, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and biomarkers. Conclusions and Relevance: ACEIs or ARBs use was not associated with higher all-cause mortality in COVID-19. However, ACEI or ARB use was independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity. Our results support the current international guidelines to continue the use of ACEIs and ARBs in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Diaz-Arocutipa","author_inst":"Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola"},{"author_name":"Jose Saucedo-Chinchay","author_inst":"Programa de Atencion Domiciliaria - Essalud"},{"author_name":"Adrian V.
