The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thivanka Muthumalage","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lucas","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Qixin Wang","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lamb","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Mathew McGraw","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"pharmacology and toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.152892","rel_title":"Interfacial Water Molecules Make RBD of SPIKE Protein and Human ACE2 to Stick Together","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.152892","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) that initially originates from Wuhan province in China has emerged as a global pandemic, an outbreak that started at the end of 2019 which claims 431,192 (Date: 15th June 2020 (https:\/\/covid19.who.in) life till now. Since then scientists all over the world are engaged in developing new vaccines, antibodies, or drug molecules to combat this new threat. Here in this work, we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions between the receptor-binding (RBD) domain of viral SPIKE protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations, computational alanine, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding affinity calculations show SARS-CoV-2 binds little more firmly to the hACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV. Analysis of simulation trajectories reveals that enhanced hydrophobic contacts or the van der Waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface. The major finding obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the RBD-ACE2 interface is populated with water molecules and interacts strongly with both RBD and ACE2 interfacial residues during the simulation periods. We also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in binding and maintaining the stability of the RBD\/hACE2 complex. The water-mediated hydrogen bond by the bridge water molecules is crucial for stabilizing the RBD and ACE2 domains. The structural and dynamical features presented here may serve as a guide for developing new drug molecules, vaccines, or antibodies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Malik","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Dwarakanath Prahlad","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Naveen Kulkarni","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Abhijit Kayal","author_inst":"Quantumzyme LLP, Bangalore India"},{"author_name":"Mathew McGraw","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.151357","rel_title":"The D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike increases transduction of multiple human cell types","rel_date":"2020-06-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.151357","rel_abs":"A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zharko Daniloski","author_inst":"New York Genome Center and NYU"},{"author_name":"Tristan X.

Among these alternatives is collection of nasal-swab samples, which can be performed by the patient, avoiding the need for healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment. Previous studies have reached opposing conclusions regarding whether nasal sampling is concordant or discordant with NP. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing follow-up. We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA\/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohen's kappa >0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies\/mL. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies\/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohen's kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD ([&ge;]1,000 copies\/mL). These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cody Callahan","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ghee Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kate E Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Neville E Sanjana","author_inst":"New York Genome Center and NYU"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20127555","rel_title":"Social media as a tool for scientific updating at the time of COVID pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20127555","rel_abs":"In the face of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals on the frontline are in urgent need of frequent updates in the accomplishment of their practice.

Ecuador was the second country in South America to report confirmed cases. The first case reported in Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, was a tourist who came from the Netherlands and presented symptoms on March 10th, 2020 (index case). In this work we used the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the metagenome of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from this case reported, and subsequently we sequenced the whole genome of the index case and other three patients using the ARTIC network protocols. Our data from the metagenomic approach confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coexisting with pathogenic bacteria suggesting coinfection. Relevant bacteria found in the BAL metagenome were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydia spp. Lineage assignment of the four whole genomes revealed three different origins. The variant HEE-01 was imported from the Netherlands and was assigned to B lineage, HGSQ-USFQ-018, belongs to the B.1 lineage showing nine nucleotide differences with the reference strain and grouped with sequences from the United Kingdom, and HGSQ-USFQ-007 and HGSQ-USFQ-010 belong to the B lineage and grouped with sequences from Scotland. All genomes show mutations in their genomes compared to the reference strain, which could be important to understand the virulence, severity and transmissibility of the virus. Our findings also suggest that there were at least three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Ecuador.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sully Marquez","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Belen Prado-Vivar","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Guadalupe","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Vegetal"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez Granja","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuel Jibaja","author_inst":"Hospital Eugenio Espejo, Quito"},{"author_name":"Milton Tobar","author_inst":"Hospital Eugenio Espejo, Quito"},{"author_name":"Francisco Mora","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Juan Gaviria","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Maria Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Edison Ligna","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Franklin Espinosa","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Jorge Reyes","author_inst":"Hospital General Sur de Quito, IESS"},{"author_name":"Veronica Barragan","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Patricio Rojas-Silva","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Trueba","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Grunauer","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Escuela de Medicina, COCSA"},{"author_name":"Paul Cardenas","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129098","rel_title":"Laboratory Testing Implications of Risk-Stratification and Management for Improving Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129098","rel_abs":"The high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients is mainly caused by the progression from mild to critical illness.

Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed using search filters that relate to asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission as well as serial interval and viral dynamics. We focused on studies that provided primary clinical data. Results 34 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review: 11 case reports pertaining to asymptomatic transmission, 9 viral kinetic studies, 13 serial interval studies, and 1 study with viral kinetics and serial interval. Conclusion Different approaches to determining the presence and prevalence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission have notable shortcomings, which were highlighted in this review and limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions. Conducting high quality studies with the aim of understanding the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is instrumental to developing the most informed policies on reopening our cities, states, and countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina Savvides","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Siegel","author_inst":"Stanford University Department Microbiology and Immunology"},{"author_name":"Ana B Queiroz","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Andrea Daneris","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Joao P Lopes","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Pereira-Cenci","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Otavio P D'Avila","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Maximiliano S Cenci","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Giana S Lima","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Flavio F Demarco","author_inst":"Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Yingdong Gao","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruisheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"COVID-19 Research Center, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"qianghu wang","author_inst":"Nanjing medical university"},{"author_name":"Shukui Wang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Grunauer","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Escuela de Medicina, COCSA"},{"author_name":"Paul Cardenas","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito, COCIBA, Instituto de Microbiologia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129221","rel_title":"Assessment of spread of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and concomitant serology in children in a region heavily affected by COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129221","rel_abs":"Background. Several studies indicated that children seem to be less frequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially less contagious. To examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we combined both RT-PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France, during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. From April 14, 2020 to May 12, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional prospective, multicenter study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory pediatricians. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and a microsample of blood for micro-method serology. Results. Among the 605 children, 322 (53.2%) were asymptomatic and 283 (46.8%) symptomatic. RT-PCR testing and serology were positive for 11 (1.8%) and 65 (10.7%) of all children, respectively. Only 3 children were RT-PCR-positive without any antibody response have been detected. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in children with positive serology than those with a negative one (12.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.001). Contact with a person with proven COVID-19 increased the odds of positivity on RT-PCR (OR 7.8, 95% confidence interval [1.5; 40.7]) and serology (15.1 [6.6; 34.6]). Conclusion. In area heavily affected by COVID-19, after the peak of the first epidemic wave and during the lockdown, the rate of children with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was very low (1.8%), but the rate of positive on serology was higher (10.7%). Most of PCR positive children had at the same time, positive serology suggesting a low risk of transmission.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Cohen","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Camille Jung","author_inst":"CRC CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Naim Ouldali","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Sellam","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Christophe Batard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Cahn-Sellem","author_inst":"AFPA"},{"author_name":"Annie Elbez","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Alain Wollner","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Olivier Romain","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Francois Corrard","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Said Aberrane","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Soismier","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Rita Creidy","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Mounira Smati-Lafarge","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Odile Launay","author_inst":"Cochin hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bechet","author_inst":"ACTIV"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Varon","author_inst":"CHI Creteil"},{"author_name":"Corinne Levy","author_inst":"ACTIV"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20122762","rel_title":"Global research trend in the treatment of the new Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) : bibliometric analysis.","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20122762","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide concern and has become a major medical problem.

The Web of Science Core Collection database was retrieved for articles on therapeutic approaches to coronavirus disease management published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus. A total of 1569 articles on coronavirus therapeutic means from 84 countries were published in 620 journals. We note the remarkable progressive increase in the number of publications related to research on therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. The United States provided the largest number of articles (405), followed by China (364). Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n=40). 1005 (64.05%) were articles, 286 (18.23%) were letters, 230 (14.66%) were reviews. The terms \"COVID- 19\" or \"SARS-CoV-2\" or \"Coronavirus\" or \"hydroxychloroquine\" or \"chloroquine\" or \"2019-nCOV\" or \"ACE2\" or \"treatment\" or \"remdesivir\" or \"pneumonia\" were most frequently used, as shown in the density visualization map. A network analysis based on keyword co-occurrence revealed five distinct types of studies: clinical, biological, epidemiological, pandemic management, and therapeutics (vaccines and treatments). COVID-19 is a major disease that has had an impact on international public health at the global level. Several avenues for treatment and vaccines have been explored. Most of them focus on older drugs used to treat other diseases that have been effective for other types of coronaviruses. There is a discrepancy in the results obtained from the studies of the drugs included in this study.

Although the situation is rapidly evolving, with datasets being continually corrected or updated, it is crucial to understand what factors may be driving transmission through different populations. While studies are beginning to highlight specific parameters that may be playing a role, few have attempted to thoroughly estimate the relative importance of these disparate variables that likely include: climate, population demographics, and imposed state interventions. In this report, we compiled a database of more than 28 potentially explanatory variables for each of the 50 U.S. states through early May 2020. Using a combination of traditional statistical and modern machine learning approaches, we identified those variables that were the most statistically significant, and, those that were the most important. These variables were chosen to be fiduciaries of a range of possible drivers for COVID-19 deaths in the USA. We found that population-weighted density (PWD), some \"stay at home\" metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation, race\/ethnicity, and chronic low respiratory death rate, were all statistically significant. Of these, PWD and mobility metrics dominated. This suggests that the biggest impact on COVID-19 deaths was, at least initially, a function of where you lived, and not what you did. However, clearly, increasing social distancing has the net effect of (at least temporarily) reducing the effective PWD. Our results strongly support the idea that the loosening of \"lock-down\" orders should be tailored to the local PWD. In contrast to these variables, while still statistically significant, race\/ethnicity, health, and climate effects could only account for a few percent of the variability in deaths. Where associations were anticipated but were not found, we discuss how limitations in the parameters chosen may mask a contribution that might otherwise be present.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pete Riley","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Allison Riley","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"James Turtle","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Naif A.M.

We find that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of NPIs. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases NPIs avoid. Framing growth in terms of doubling times, rather than growth rates, reduces bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained, rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of NPIs correctly. These findings suggest changes that public health authorities can adopt to better communicate the exponential spread of infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Schonger","author_inst":"ETH Zurich and HSLU"},{"author_name":"Daniela Sele","author_inst":"ETH-Bereich Hochschulen"},{"author_name":"James Turtle","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Michal Ben-Nun","author_inst":"Predictive Science Inc."},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Naif A.M.

Here, we have identified distinct members of the family of polyether ionophore antibiotics with potent ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathogenicity in cells. Several compounds from this class displayed more than 100-fold selectivity between viral-induced cytopathogenicity and inhibition of cell viability, however the compound X-206 displayed >500-fold selectivity and was furthermore able to inhibit viral replication even at sub-nM levels. The antiviral mechanism of the polyether ionophores is currently not understood in detail. We demonstrate, through unbiased bioactivity profiling, that their effects on the host cells differ from those of cationic amphiphiles such as hydroxychloroquine. Collectively, our data suggest that polyether ionophore antibiotics should be subject to further investigations as potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esben B.

The viral spike, which mediates entry into cells by interacting with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is the primary target of most vaccines in development. These vaccines aim to elicit protective immunity against the glycoprotein by use of inactivated virus, vector-mediated delivery of the antigen in vivo, or by direct immunization with the purified antigen following expression in a heterologous system. These approaches are mostly dependent on the growth of mammalian or insect cells, which requires a sophisticated infrastructure that is not generally available in developing countries due to the incumbent costs which are prohibitive. Plant-based subunit vaccine production has long been considered as a cheaper alternative, although low expression yields and differences along the secretory pathway to mammalian cells have posed a challenge to producing certain viral glycoproteins. Recent advances that have enabled many of these constraints to be addressed include expressing the requisite human proteins in plants to support the maturation of the protein of interest. In this study we investigated these approaches to support the production of a soluble and putatively trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike mimetic in Nicotiana benthamiana via transient Agrobacterium-mediated expression. The co-expression of human calreticulin dramatically improved the accumulation of the viral spike, which was barely detectable in the absence of the co-expressed accessory protein. The viral antigen was efficiently processed even in the absence of co-expressed furin, suggesting that processing may have occurred at the secondary cleavage site and was mediated by an endogenous plant protease. In contrast, the spike was not efficiently processed when expressed in mammalian cells as a control, although the co-expression of furin improved processing considerably. This study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular engineering to improve the production of viral glycoproteins in plants, and supports plant-based production of SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines and reagents for serological assays.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emmanuel Aubrey Margolin","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Matthew Verbeek","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ann Meyers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Rosamund Chapman","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lise Williamson","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Edward Rybicki","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ting Yuan","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Kanako Mori","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Axel Guzman Solis","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Masahiro Yamashita","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons"},{"author_name":"Lawrence J.

Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity. Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS, and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have designed as a result of this work shows promising result indicating its potential capability of simulating an immune response.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muniba Faiza","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Review"},{"author_name":"Tariq Abdullah","author_inst":"IQL Technologies Pvt.

positive-sense RNA virus families within the Nidovirales order, which are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Coronaviruses have an extensive range of natural hosts and are known to be responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases in multiple species. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains. Further, we also performed a detailed prediction for B and T cell epitopes using BepiPred 2.0 server and NetCTL 1.2 server (DTU Bioinformatics), respectively. We hope this information may assist in an effective vaccine designing program against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruby Dhar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akhauri Yash Sinha","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Ashikh A Seethy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Anusha Matta","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Pethusamy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Trymbak Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Indrani Mukherjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sajib Sarkar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Minocha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kakali Purkayastha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Jai Bhagwan Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Paine","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Subhradip Karmakar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanat Ali","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Ranjit Vijayan","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Ashikh A Seethy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sri Anusha Matta","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Karthikeyan Pethusamy","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Trymbak Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Indrani Mukherjee","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sajib Sarkar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Minocha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kakali Purkayastha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Jai Bhagwan Sharma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Paine","author_inst":"Bencos Research Solution, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Subhradip Karmakar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Methods: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonia Johnson","author_inst":"NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit, Division of

However, neutralizing antibody (nAb) in convalescents is largely unknown. We found that 97.01% (65\/67) of COVID-19 convalescents maintained IgG antibodies with high binding and avidity to SARS-CoV-2 spike subunits S1 and S2, and 95.52% (64\/67) had neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pesudovirus, one month after discharge (median ID50, 2.75; IQR, 2.34-3.08). Some sera exhibited cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV (76.12%), MERS-CoV (17.91%), or both (10.45%). Interestingly, individuals recovered from severe disease (severe group) had nAbs with binding and neutralization titers higher than non-severe group. Severe group appeared a rapid increase of lymphocytes and a high proportion of circulating CXCR3+ Tfh cells. Interestingly, the later were spike-specific and positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 nAb titers. All subjects had no autoimmunity. Our findings provide novel insights into nAb responses in COVID-19 convalescents and facilitate treatment and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian Zhang","author_inst":"Translational Medicine Institute, The First Peoples Hospital of Chenzhou, University of South

COVID-19 is a priority to maintain a safe and functioning healthcare system. The risk of transmitting COVID-19 to family members is a source of stress for many. Objective: To describe and compare HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, as well as the frequency of COVID-19 among HCWs household members. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario which captures all COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with COVID-19 as of 14 May 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address. Exposures and Outcomes: We contrasted age, gender, comorbidities, clinical presentation (including asymptomatic and presymptomatic), exposure histories including nosocomial transmission, and clinical outcomes between HCWs and non-HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Results: There were 4,230 (17.5%) HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, of whom 20.2% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 77.4% other specialties. HCWs were more likely to be between 30-60 years of age and female. HCWs were more likely to present asymptomatically (8.1% versus 7.0%, p=0.010) or with atypical symptoms (17.8% versus 10.5%, p<0.001). The mortality among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 10.5% of non-HCWs. HCWs commonly had exposures to a confirmed case or outbreak (74.1%), however only 3.1% were confirmed to be nosocomial. The rate of new infections was 5.5 times higher in HCWs than non-HCWs, but mirrored the epidemic curve. We identified 391 (9.8%) probable secondary household transmissions and 143 (3.6%) acquisitions. Children <19 years comprised 14.6% of secondary cases compared to only 4.2% of the primary cases. Conclusions and Relevance: HCWs represent a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario but with low confirmed numbers of nosocomial transmission. The data support substantial testing bias and under-ascertainment of general population cases. Protecting HCWs through appropriate personal protective equipment and physical distancing from colleagues is paramount.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin L

venous thromboembolism and there are multiple data regarding high incidence of venous thrombosis in critical COVID-19 patients, however reports on this complication in less severe patients are not widely available. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and to assess the prevalence of DVT with lung computerized tomography (lung CT) exams, clinical information and lab data. This study examined 75 consecutive patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, with specific exclusions. METHODS Almost all patients (pts) admitted to our hospital in the first half of May underwent comprehensive vein ultrasonography. 75 pts (aged 27-92 y, median - 63 y, 36 males and 39 females) with moderate to severe COVID-19 were included in our study. RESULTS Spontaneous echo contrast (decreased blood velocity and blood stasis) was detected in common femoral veins in 53 pts (70.7%). DVT was found in 15 pts (20%). The vast majority of those with DVT (13 pts, 86.7%) had thrombi only in calf veins and ileofemoral thrombosis was detected in 2 pts with DVT (13.3%). There was no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to age, underlying diseases, lung CT scores and SpaO2 at admission. There was also no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to both \"time from symptoms onset to admission\" and with respect to the majority of lab data. However, a significant difference was observed in D-dimer level (1.87 +\/- 1.62 vs 0.51 +\/- 0,4 mcg\/mL p<0.0001) and C-reactive protein (116.9 +\/- 83,6 and 65.1 +\/- 64.98 mg\/L, p = 0.014) for patients with DVT and patients without DVT respectably (Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the level of D-dimer >\/= 0.69 mcg\/mL is the predictor of DVT with a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 77.6%, p < 0.001 (AUC area under curve = 0.7944). Logistic regression confirmed that D-dimer is an independent predictor of DVT and patients with D-dimer >\/= 0.69 mcg\/mL have odds ratio (OR) of developing DVT = 5.1 (confidence interval [CI] 1.9 - 13.5)). CONCLUSION Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 show high incidence of DVT, indicating that moderate to severe COVID-19 patients may require an early administration of anticoagulation therapy as part of their treatment. Such therapy may be continued after hospital discharge. Based on these findings, these patients may also require a follow-up with vein ultrasonography after recovery to rule out DVT.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oleg B

characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the mean serial interval. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we build a model including an additional compartment of infectious individuals who stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported serial interval, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. We find that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed so far, but has different implications for the future predictions in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures. Considering the role of modeling in important decisions such as easing lockdown measures and adjusting hospital capacity, we believe that it is critically important to consider a chronically infectious population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burcu Tepekule","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Viacheslav Nikolaevich Kachalov","author_inst":"University of Zurich, University Hospital of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Sara Andresen","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Scheier","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Peter W.
