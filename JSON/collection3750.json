This may have negative consequences for peoples health and wellbeing. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 disease attributable to training facilities. Methods: we randomized members 18 to 64 years with no COVID-19 relevant comorbidities at five training facilities in Oslo, Norway to access or no access to their facility. Facilities were opened from May 22, 2020 for individuals randomized to training, applying increased social distancing (1 meter for floor exercise, 2 meters for high-intensity classes), enhanced hand and surface hygiene. Locker rooms were open, showers and saunas were closed. We compared SARS-CoV-2 PCR status by self-administered naso-, oropharyngeal and sputum sampling after two weeks and clinical disease by linkage to electronic patient records after three weeks. Results: 3,764 individuals were randomized and included in analyses; 1,896 in the training and 1,868 in no-training arms. In the training arm, 81.8 percent trained at least once at the facilities. Out of 3,016 individuals who returned the SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, there was one positive test. The positive individual was randomized to training, but had not used the facility before testing day. Contact tracing revealed the workplace as transmission source. A total of 106 individuals had outpatient hospital visits, and six individuals were admitted to hospital during the three weeks after intervention start, with no differences between arms. There were no outpatient visits or hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in either group. Conclusions: Provided good hygiene and social distancing measures, there was no increased COVID-19 spread at training facilities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- TRAiN study group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Michael Bretthauer","author_inst":"University of Oslo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138024","rel_title":"Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138024","rel_abs":"Background: Online respondent-driven detection (online-RDD) is a novel method of case-finding that can enhance contact tracing. However, the advantages and challenges of online-RDD for contact tracing (CT) have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply online-RDD for contact tracing. Methods: First, between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the diffusion of innovations theory. Second, between May and June 2019 we distributed an online questionnaire to 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using hypothetical scenarios that involved close-contact pathogens (scabies, shigella, and mumps), we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of online-RDD and PHPs intention to apply online-RDD for contact tracing. Results: Twelve interviews were held and 70 PHPs filled in the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using online-RDD for contact tracing. Anticipated advantages of online-RDD were related to accommodating easy and autonomous participation in contact tracing of patients and contact persons, and reaching contact persons more efficiently. Anticipated challenges with online-RDD were related to limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of contact tracing, adequately conveying measures to patients and contact persons, and anticipated unrest among patients and contact persons. Online-RDD was considered more applicable when patients and their contact persons are reluctant to share sensitive information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons are involved, and the scope of contact tracing is large. Online-RDD was considered less applicable when consequences of missing information or individuals are severe for individuals - or public health, when measures that patients and contact persons need to undertake are complex or impactful, and when a disease is perceived as particularly severe or sensitive by patients and their contact persons. Conclusions: PHPs generally perceived online-RDD as beneficial to public health practice. The method can help overcome challenges present in regular CT and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close-contact, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We propose a staggered implementation study to further investigate the application of online-RDD for enhanced CT during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yannick B.

Three months on, the disease and our understanding have both evolved significantly. As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities. Methods We undertook a mixed methods study seeking the views of the global research community to i) assess which of the early WHO roadmap priorities are still most pressing; ii) understand whether they are still valid in different settings, regions or countries; and iii) identify any new emerging priorities. Results Thematic analysis of the significant body of combined data shows the WHO roadmap is globally relevant, however, new important priorities have emerged, in particular, pertinent to low and lower-middle income countries (less resourced countries), where health systems are under significant competing pressures. We also found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future. Conclusion We hope these findings will help guide decision making across the broad research system including the multi-lateral partners, research funders, public health practitioners, clinicians and civil society.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Norton","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Arancha De La Horra Gozalo","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Nicole Feune de Colombi","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Moses Alobo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Juliete Mutheu Asego","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Zainab Al-Rawni","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Emila Antonio","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"James Parker","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Wayne Mwangi","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Colette Adhiambo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Kevin Marsh","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Marta Tufet Bayona","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Piot","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Trudie A.

A main consequence of inactivity is a poorer general health and a higher mortality rate. Therefore, it is important to inform the public about practical recommendations for staying physically active, especially during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Through a systematic review of literature in two databases (Pubmed\/Medline; Web of Science), studies were analysed which include practical recommendations for staying active during Covid-19 (Q1), or if they did not explicitly deal with Covid-19, research with useful results regarding the adaption to the present situation (Q2). Results: Currently, there are 6 studies published which are related to the first research question. In total, 26 papers, were found to correlate to the second one. Conclusion: Researchers need to be more specific in the exact recommendations for different age-groups and various health statuses. Key sources are the websites of the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association. In addition, exergames need to be adaptable to restrictions by product designers and to integrate social interaction-functions. Furthermore, it is essential that governmental actions need to be taken, with the help of researchers, to inform citizens about possible physical activities, with precise examples, clarification of benefits of the exercises, the exact exercise with duration, intensity and other substitute tasks for different age-groups and for people with diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Achraf Ammar","author_inst":"Otto-von-Guericke University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"Observatoire National du Sport; Universite de Sfax, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"Universite de Sfax, ; Sport et Sante, Tunisie"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Germany"},{"author_name":"James Parker","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health"},{"author_name":"Wayne Mwangi","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Colette Adhiambo","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Kevin Marsh","author_inst":"African Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Marta Tufet Bayona","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Peter Piot","author_inst":"UK Collaborative on Development Research"},{"author_name":"Trudie A.

This study aims to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and case-fatality rate of AKI in patients with documented COVID-19. Methods We reviewed the health medical records of 307 consecutive patients hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19 at the University Hospital of Modena, Italy. Results AKI was diagnosed in 69 out of 307 (22.4%) patients. The stages of AKI were stage 1 in 57.9%, stage 2 in 24.6% and stage 3 in 17.3%. Hemodialysis was performed in 7.2% of the subjects. AKI patients had a mean age of 74.7 {+\/-} 9.9 years and higher serum levels of the main marker of inflammation and organ involvement (lung, liver, hearth and liver) than non-AKI patients. AKI events were more frequent in subjects with severe lung comprise. Two peaks of AKI events coincided with in-hospital admission and death of the patients. Kidney injury was associate with a higher rate of urinary abnormalities including proteinuria (0.448{+\/-} 0.85 vs 0.18 {+\/-} 0.29; P=<0.0001) and hematuria (P=0.032) compared to non-AKI patients. At the end of follow-up, 65.2% of the patients did not recover their renal function after AKI. Risk factors for kidney injury were age, male sex, CKD and non-renal SOFA. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR]=3.74; CI 95%, 1.34-10.46) compared to non-AKI patients. Groups of patients with AKI stage 2-3 and failure to recover kidney function were associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality. Lastly, long-hospitalization was positively associated with a decrease of serum creatinine, likely due to muscle depletion occurred with prolonged bed rest. Conclusions AKI was a dire consequence of patients with COVID-19. Identification of patients at high-risk for AKI and prevention of kidney injury by avoiding dehydration and nephrotoxic agents is imperative in this vulnerable cohort of patients.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Alfano","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Ferrari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesco Fontana","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Mori","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Magistroni","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Meschiari Marianna","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Franceschini Erica","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Menozzi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di  Modena"},{"author_name":"Paolo Raggi","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology 4A7.050 Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute"},{"author_name":"Massimo Girardis","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138859","rel_title":"Using Machine Learning of Clinical Data to Diagnose COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138859","rel_abs":"The recent pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed severe stress on healthcare systems worldwide, which is amplified by the critical shortage of COVID-19 tests.

We aimed to investigate correlations between clinical variables, cluster COVID-19 patients into subtypes, and generate a computational classification model for discriminating between COVID -19 patients and influenza patients based on clinical variables alone. We discovered several novel associations between clinical variables, including correlations between being male and having higher levels of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils. We found that COVID-19 patients could be clustered into subtypes based on serum levels of immune cells, gender, and reported symptoms. Finally, we trained an XGBoost model to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 97.9% in discriminating COVID-19 patients from influenza patients. We demonstrated that computational methods trained on large clinical datasets could yield ever more accurate COVID-19 diagnostic models to mitigate the impact of lack of testing. We also presented previously unknown COVID-19 clinical variable correlations and clinical subgroups.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Tse Li","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jiayan Ma","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Neil Shende","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Grant Castaneda","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jaideep Chakladar","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Joseph C.

COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Giuseppe Giobbe","author_inst":"University College London - GOS Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bonfante","author_inst":"izsvenezie"},{"author_name":"Elisa Zambaiti","author_inst":"University College London - GOS Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Onelia Gagliano","author_inst":"VIMM"},{"author_name":"Brendan C.

Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 24 samples at a time. There is a need for a higher throughput method to reduce cost per genome. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 95 small genomes on a single Nanopore flowcell, which uses transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of symmetric barcodes. We demonstrate the method using 48 and 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per flowcell, amplified using the ARTIC protocol, and compare performance with Illumina and ARTIC ONT sequencing. Results demonstrate that all sequencing methods produce inaccurate genomes when the RNA extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical sample has a cycle threshold (Ct) >= 32. Results from set same set of 23 samples with a broad range of Cts show that the consensus genomes have >90% coverage (GISAID criteria) for 78.2% of samples for CoronaHiT-48, 73.9% for CoronaHiT-94, 78.2% for Illumina and 73.9% for ARTIC ONT, and all have the same clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per nanopore flowcell without compromising the quality of the resulting genomes while reducing library preparation complexity and significantly reducing cost. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David J Baker","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Gemma L Kay","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Alp Aydin","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Thanh Le-Viet","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Steven Rudder","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience"},{"author_name":"Ana P Tedim","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience, Grupo de Investigacion Biomedica en Sepsis - BioSepsis.

Repurposing existing entities is one attractive approach. The heparan sulfate mimetic pixatimod is a clinical-stage synthetic sulfated compound that is a potent inhibitor of the glycosidase heparanase, and has known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and also antiviral properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and alters its conformation. Notably, this site overlaps with the known ACE2 binding site in the S1 RBD. We find that pixatimod inhibits binding of recombinant S1 RBD to Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, in assays with three different isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus we show that pixatimod effectively inhibits viral infection of Vero cells. Importantly, its potency is well within its safe therapeutic dose range. These data provide evidence that pixatimod is a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. Together with its other known activities this provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation as a new multimodal therapeutic for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott E Guimond","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Courtney J Mycroft-West","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Neha S Gandhi","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Julia A Tree","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karen R Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nystrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.168013","rel_title":"Evaluation of Different PCR Assay Formats for Sensitive and Specific Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.168013","rel_abs":"Accurate identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for efforts to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in patient samples and are used extensively in clinical settings. Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection. Overall, these findings highlight the need for assay validation and optimization and demonstrate the inability to precisely compare viral quantification from different PCR methodologies without calibration.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Ratcliff","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dung Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Uinversity of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Karen R Buttigieg","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nystrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.162941","rel_title":"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.162941","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.\n\nMethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.\n\nHighlightsBrain tissue injury increases ACE2 levels in the lungs\n\nBrain injury induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the lungs\n\nBrain injury causes parenchymal inflammation and systemic lymphopenia","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vikramjeet Singh","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Beer","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Kraus","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Xiaoni Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jinhua Xue","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dirk M Hermann","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Gunzer","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, DE-45147 Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joanna Said","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Yin Xiang Setoh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alberto Amarilla","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.167916","rel_title":"In silico identification of conserved cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.167916","rel_abs":"AimThe aim of this study was to computationally predict conserved RNA sequences and structures known as cis-acting RNA elements (CREs) located within the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\n\nMaterials & methodsBioinformatics tools were used to analyse and predict cis-acting regulatory elements by obtaining viral sequences from available databases.\n\nResultsComputational analysis prediction revealed the presence of RNA stem-loop structures within the 3 end of the ORF1ab region that are analogous to the previously identified SARS-CoV genomic packaging signals.

The power inherent in publicly available data can be demonstrated via comparative transcriptome analyses. In the current study, we collected high-throughput gene expression data related to human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses (SARS, H1N1, rhinovirus, avian influenza, and Dhori) and compared the effect of these viruses on the human transcriptome. The analyses identified fifteen genes specifically expressed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2; these included CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and S100A8 and S100A9 (calcium-binding proteins), all of which are involved in lung\/respiratory disorders. The analyses showed that genes involved in the Type1 interferon signaling pathway and the apoptosis process are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, results of protein-protein interaction analyses were consistent with a functional role of CSF2 in COVID-19 disease.

The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies. Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine development work.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sridevi Krishnan","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Giri P Krishnan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Tommaso A.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.\n\nWe collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre\/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.\n\nIn inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD\/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.\n\nIntestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bram Verstockt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sare Verstockt","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Saeed Adbu Rahiman","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bo-Jun Ke","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Kaline Arnauts","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cleynen","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Joao Sabino","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Ferrante","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Matteoli","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Severine Vermeire","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.168252","rel_title":"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.168252","rel_abs":"STUDY QUESTIONIs SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) expressed in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and does it participate in endometrial decidualization?\n\nSUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.\n\nPARTICIPANTS\/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).\n\nLARGE SCALE DATAN\/A.\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.\n\nSTUDY FUNDINGS\/COMPETING INTEREST(S)This study was supported by National Institutes of Health \/ National Institute of Child Health and Human Development grants R01HD065435 and R00HD080742 to RK and Washington University School of Medicine start-up funds to RK.

This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heather M Froggatt","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Brook E Heaton","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Heaton","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Ramakrishna Kommagani","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kaline Arnauts","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cleynen","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Joao Sabino","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marc Ferrante","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Matteoli","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Severine Vermeire","author_inst":"University Hospitals, Leuven and KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Naphak Modhiran","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Du Jun Julian Sng","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mohit Chhabra","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Watterson","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Paul R Young","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Alexander A Khromykh","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Marcelo A Lima","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"David G Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin A Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edward Hammond","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Keith Dredge","author_inst":"Zucero Ltd"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Trybala","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Tomas Bergstrom","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Vito Ferro","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Mark A Skidmore","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Jeremy E Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.169094","rel_title":"Modelling donor screening strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 via fecal microbiota transplantation","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.169094","rel_abs":"The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool via fecal microbiota transplantation is not yet known, and the effectiveness of various testing strategies to prevent FMT-based transmission has also not yet been quantified.

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2.

Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2\/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1\/2\/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures.

Our results suggest that extreme social distancing without intensive testing is ineffective in extinguishing COVID-19. This finding has profound epidemiological significance and sheds light on the controversy regarding the relative effectiveness of widespread testing and social distancing. Our simple epidemiological simulator is also useful for assessing the efficacy of governmental\/societal responses to an outbreak.

University administrators are now facing decisions about how to safely return students, staff and faculty to campus. To provide a framework to evaluate various strategies, we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. Our goals were to support the immediate pandemic planning at our own university, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. We parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size private university in Atlanta, Georgia. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explore a range of screening and testing frequencies and perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of input parameters. We find that monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 42% and 80% in students, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay results in an 88%, 79% and 67% reduction in cumulative incidence in students over the semester, respectively. Similar reductions are observed among staff and faculty. A testing strategy requires far fewer diagnostic assays to be implemented than a screening assay. Our intervention model is conservative in that we assume a fairly high reproductive number that is not reduced through social distancing measures. We find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, but that cases, hospitalization, and (in some scenarios) deaths may still occur. In addition to estimating health impacts, this model can help to predict the resource requirements in terms of diagnostic capacity and isolation\/quarantine facilities associated with different strategies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Lopman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Carol Liu","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Adrien Le Guillou","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andreas Handel","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Timothy L Lash","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Isakov","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Jenness","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Bhargava","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Tanu Singhal","author_inst":"Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Annsea Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

Methods We searched for SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in the entire voluntary population using lateral flow immune-cromatographic tests on capillary blood (rapid tests). We then performed chemioluminescent serological assays (CLIA) and naso-pharyngeal swabs in a randomized representative sample of 562 subjects and in every subject with a positive rapid test. Results Based on CLIA serologies on the representative random sample (509 subjects), we estimated a 23% IgG seroprevalence. We also found a strong correlation between age and prevalence, with the elderly showing the highest probability of a positive serological test. Conclusions In an area of unrestricted viral circulation less than one-fourth of the population tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Seroprevalence increased with increasing age, possibly suggesting differences in susceptibility to the infection.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Universita' Degli Studi Di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Rossana Rondanin","author_inst":"Medispa"},{"author_name":"Andrea Prina","author_inst":"Medispa"},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie - Sorbonne Universite'"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Ottomano","author_inst":"Synlab Italia"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

Furthermore, DELPHI successfully predicted the large-scale epidemics in many areas months before, including US, UK and Russia. Using the extracted government response, we find mass gathering restrictions and school closings on average reduced infection rates the most, at 29.9 {+\/-} 6.9% and 17.3 {+\/-} 6.7%, respectively. The most stringent policy, stay-at-home, on average reduced the infection rate by 74.4 {+\/-} 3.7% from baseline across countries that implemented it.

In this study we propose a birth-and-death model for predicting the number of COVID-19 active cases. It relation to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model has been discussed. An explicit expression for the expected number of active cases helps us to identify a stationary point on the infection curve, where the infection ceases increasing. Parameters of the model are estimated by fitting the expressions for active and total reported cases simultaneously. We analyzed the movement of the stationary point and the basic reproduction number during the infection period up to the 20th of April 2020.

To explore the effect of topology we assumed the social network over which the disease spreads to have small-world or scale-free properties characterized by a rewiring probability and degree distribution respectively. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified the spreading dynamics of infection over a given graph structure through changes in properties of agent interaction. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Thereafter, lockdown efficacy was evaluated as a function of lockdown start times and duration. Thus, we propose that ABM approach can be used to assess various lockdown strategies that aim to prevent breakdown of medical infrastructure while accounting for realistic social network configurations specific to a local population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anagh Pathak","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Varun Madan Mohan","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Arpan Banerjee","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Trikalinos","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos K Trichakis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie - Sorbonne Universite'"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Ottomano","author_inst":"Synlab Italia"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.
