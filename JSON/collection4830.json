Until now, no treatment has proven to be effective in COVID-19. To explore whether the use of remdesivir, initially an experimental broad-spectrum antiviral, is effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating its use. Methods A rapid search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE medical databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials. A systematic approach was used to screen, abstract, and critically appraise the studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was applied to rate the certainty and quality of the evidence reported per study. Results Two RCTs studies were identified (n=1,299). A fixed-effects meta-analysis revealed reductions in mortality (RR=0.69, 0.49 to 0.99), time to clinical improvement (3.95 less days, from 3.86 days less to 4.05 less days ), serious adverse events (RR=0.77, 0.63 to 0.94) and all adverse events (RR=0.87, 0.79 to 0.96). Conclusion In this rapid systematic review, we present pooled evidence from the 2 included RCT studies that reveal that remdesivir has a modest yet significant reduction in mortality and significantly improves the time to recovery, as well as significantly reduced risk in adverse events and serious adverse events. It is more than likely that as an antiviral, remdesivir is not sufficient on its own and may be suitable in combination with other antivirals or treatments such as convalescent plasma. Research is ongoing to clarify and contextual these promising findings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul E Alexander","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Piticaru","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kim Lewis","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Komal Aryal","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Priya Thomas","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Szczeklik","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jakub Fronczek","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kamil Polok","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alhazzani","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mammen","author_inst":"The State University of New York at Buffalo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20112318","rel_title":"Utility of Pan-Family Assays for Rapid Viral Screening: Reducing Delays in Public Health Responses During Pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20112318","rel_abs":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted deficiencies in the testing capacity of many developed countries during the early stages of emerging pandemics. Here we describe the potential for pan-family viral assays to improve early accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. Methods Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were used as a case-study for investigating the utility of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for viral detection was assessed using the frequency of common human coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 and 59 other coronavirus species. The resilience of the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed in 8893 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing utility during pandemic progression. Findings Due to infection with common HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return a false positive for as few as 1% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30% of immunocompromised patients displaying symptoms of respiratory disease. Two of the four reported pan-coronavirus assays would have identified SARS-CoV-2 and we demonstrate that with small adjustments to the primers, these assays can accommodate novel variation observed in animal coronaviruses. The assay target region of one well established Pan-CoV assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to regions targeted by other widely applied SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. Interpretation Pan-family assays have the potential to greatly assist management of emerging public health emergencies through prioritization of high-resolution testing or isolation measures, despite limitations in test specificity due to cross-reactivity with common pathogens. Targeting highly conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and resilient to mutation of a given virus. This approach may be applicable to other viral families and has utility as part of a strategic stockpile of tests maintained to better contain spread of novel diseases prior to the widespread availability of specific assays.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Erlichster","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Gursharan Chana","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Daniela Zantomio","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Goudey","author_inst":"IBM Research Australia"},{"author_name":"Efstratios Skafidas","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Szczeklik","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jakub Fronczek","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kamil Polok","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alhazzani","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mammen","author_inst":"The State University of New York at Buffalo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111245","rel_title":"IgG serology in health care and administrative staff populations from 7 hospital representative of different exposures to SARS-CoV-2 in Lombardy, Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111245","rel_abs":"Lombardy is one of the regions in Italy most affected by COVID-19.

Subjects filled an anamnestic questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, co-morbidities, smoking, regular or smart-working, and the exposure to COVID-19-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical area where the hospital was located and ranged between 3 to 43% which correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 in Lombardy. There was a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the response. We observed 10% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 20% with one or two symptoms. 81% of individuals presenting both anosmia\/ageusia and fever resulted SARS-CoV-2 infected. IgG positivity correlated with family contacts. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and to extra-hospital exposure.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Sandri","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Elena Azzolini","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Valter Torri","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"},{"author_name":"Sara Carloni","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Michele Tedeschi","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Massimo Castoldi","author_inst":"Humanitas Gavazzeni and Castelli"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mantovani","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Rescigno","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alhazzani","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mammen","author_inst":"The State University of New York at Buffalo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113191","rel_title":"Improved detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 by microsphere-based antibody assay","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113191","rel_abs":"Objective: Currently available COVID-19 antibody tests using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunochromatographic assay have variable sensitivity and specificity. Here, we developed and evaluated a novel microsphere-based antibody assay (MBA) for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Method: We developed a microsphere-based assay (MBA) to determine the levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike RBD. The seropositive cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among patients with COVID-19. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S\/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA. Results: MBA had a specificity of 100% (93\/93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG and 98.9% (92\/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG. The MBA seropositive rate for convalescent serum specimens of COVID-19 patients were 89.8% (35\/39) for anti-NP IgG and 79.5% (31\/39) for anti-RBD IgG. The time-to-seropositivity was shorter with MBA than that of EIA. When compared with EIA, MBA could better differentiate between COVID-19 patients and negative controls with significantly higher S\/CO ratio for COVID-19 patients and lower S\/CO ratio with negative controls. MBA also had fewer specimens in the equivocal range (S\/CO 0.9-1.1) than EIA. Conclusion: MBA is robust and simple, and is suitable for clinical microbiology laboratory for the accurate determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody for retrospective diagnosis, serosurveillance, and vaccine trials.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carol Ho Yan Fong","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Thrimendra Kaushika Dissanayake","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lin-Lei Chen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Yee-Ki Choi","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lok-Hin Wong","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Anthony Chin-Ki Ng","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Polly K.P Pang","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Deborah Tip-Yin Ho","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rosana Wing-Shan Poon","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111401","rel_title":"Association of Renin Angiotensin System Blockers with Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111401","rel_abs":"Background: Patients with cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of critical illness and mortality from Covid-19 disease. Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic. Objective: To study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI\/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI\/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model. Main Outcome measures: In-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Results: Fifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI\/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI\/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI\/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI\/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI\/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe\/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI\/ARB users. Conclusion: There is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI\/ARB compared with non-users. In patients with hypertension, ACE\/ARB use might be associated with reduced mortality, however these findings need to be confirmed in prospective randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aakash Garg","author_inst":"Newark Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amit Rout","author_inst":"Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Sharma","author_inst":"Gunderson Lutheran Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany Fiorello","author_inst":"Cambridge Health Alliance"},{"author_name":"John B.

This fact was confirmed early during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted several studies that proposed monitoring its incidence by wastewater. This paper studies the fate of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater treatment plants using RT-qPCR with a two-fold goal: i) to check the safety of the water effluent and also of the sludge produced and ii) based on the understanding of the virus particles fate, to identify the most suitable spots for detecting the incidence of COVID-19 and monitor its evolution. On the grounds of the affinity of enveloped virus towards biosolids, we hypothesized that the sludge line acts as a concentrator of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Sampling several spots in primary, secondary and sludge treatment at the Ourense (Spain) WWTP showed that, in effect, most of SARS-CoV-2 particles cannot be detected in the water effluent as they are retained by the sludge line. We identified the sludge thickener as a suitable spot for detecting SARS-CoV-2 particles thanks to its higher solids concentration (more virus particles) and longer residence time (less sensitive to dilution caused by precipitation). Although more studies will be needed for confirmation, these results contribute to clarify the role of WWTPs in COVID-19 mitigation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabela Balboa","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mauricio-Iglesias","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Santiago Rodr\u00edguez","author_inst":"Viaqua, S.A."},{"author_name":"Luc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez-Lamas","author_inst":"Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-Universidade de Vigo"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Vasallo","author_inst":"Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur) SERGAS-Universidade de Vigo"},{"author_name":"Benito Regueiro","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Juan M Lema","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Deborah Tip-Yin Ho","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rosana Wing-Shan Poon","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20092817","rel_title":"Inferring the effective start dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19 outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20092817","rel_abs":"During Feb-Apr 2020, many countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures and lockdowns, with variable schedules, to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Many experts worldwide predict it to happen in India between end of May and end of July. Objectives: The aim of this research was to find an answer that whether India would come across the looming conditions of SARS-COVID-19 in coming days given the prevailing circumstances so far. Methods: The proposed approach used fundamental concept of Statistics by fixing the standard reference to the number of daily new tests conducted by a country. We thus computed the percentage of daily new cases and daily new deaths, in using such references. The trends were studied using simple line chart. The theory of three sigma was also used to build the upper bound for daily new cases and deaths, specifically for India to see the extreme conditions. Results: The analysis was done using data from January to till May 18, 2020 for India, Italy, USA and UK. The trend of India was almost fix between ~2% to ~6% till May 18, 2020. On contrary, Italy, USA and UK were touched the Peak on March 29, 2020 (24.38%), April 26, 2020 (23.51%) and April 24, 2020 (24.91%), respectively and declining since then. Similar trends were also noted in daily new deaths, except Italy. Conclusions: The proposed new concept for fixing universal reference provides a consistent and coherent results. It is thus clear from observed data so far that India is not going to encounter the frightened conditions or peak, like, Italy, USA, and UK for pandemic SARS-COVID-19, given the existing conditions, excluding the current migration.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pramod K.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative public health strategies to control the spread. Here, we have conducted an online search for all relevant public health interventions for COVID-19. We then characterize and summarize the global COVID-19 pandemic situation and recommend potential mitigation strategies in the context of Ethiopia. Methods: Initial search of Pub Med central and Google scholar was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words; COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2, Global lessons and Pandemic; A second search using all identified keywords including COVID-19, Epidemiology, Sociocultural, Ethiopia; thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched. Accordingly, of the 1,402 articles, 39 were included in the analysis for this review. Result: Countries COVID-19 mitigation strategies widely varied. The most common global COVID-19 mitigation strategies include; whole of government approach including individual, community and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings and international travel measures. Models revealed that, social and physical distancing alone could prevent the pandemic from 60-95%, if timely and effectively implemented. Moreover, detecting and isolation of cases were found to be crucial while access to testing was found to the global challenge. Individual measures including proper hand washing were also reported to be effective measures in preventing the pandemic. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 ranged from 25% to 80% and as a result, countries are revising the case definition for early detection of mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with inclusion of Chills, Muscle pain and new loss of taste or smell in addition to Cough, Shortness of breath, Fever and Sore throat. Global reports also revealed that the incubation period of COVID-19 could go to 24 days. Ethiopia is also unique in the aspects of sociocultural prospects while more than 99.3% of the population has a religion. Moreover, 69% of the population is under the age of 29 years old and the health policy in the country focused on prevention and primary health care. All these could be potential entries and opportunities to combat COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Ethiopia. Conclusion: While recommendations may change depending on the level of outbreak, we conclude that in Most countries have benefited from early interventions and in setups like Africa including Ethiopia where health system capability is limited, community engagement supported by local evidence with strict implementation of social and physical distancing measures is mandatory. Active involvement of religious Institutions and mobilizing youth could be entry to increase public awareness in mitigating COVID-19. Community level case detection could enhance early identification of cases which could be implemented through the health extension program. Isolation and quarantine beyond 14 days could help identify long term carriers of COVID-19. Validation and use of rapid test kits could be vital to increase access for testing. Revision of case definitions for COVID-19 could be important for early detection and identification of mild symptomatic cases.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yimam Getaneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ajanaw Yizengaw","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Sisay Adane","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Kidist Zealiyas","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Zelalem Abate","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Sileshi Leulseged","author_inst":"ICAP-Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Hailemichael Desalegn","author_inst":"St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical Collage"},{"author_name":"Getnet Yimer","author_inst":"Global One Health Initiative,East Africal Regional office"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.112284","rel_title":"SciSight: Combining faceted navigation and research group detection for COVID-19 exploratory scientific search","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.112284","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented mobilization of scientists, already generating thousands of new papers that join a litany of previous biomedical work in related areas.

Based on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools, we build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between biomedical facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient characteristics); and second, discovering groups of researchers and how they are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained on several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we use hierarchical clustering with overlap to allow authors, as they do, to belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel presentation of these groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query suggestions on the fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation.\n\nSciSight1 has thus far served over 10K users with over 30K page views and 13% returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical researchers suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and relevant knowledge.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Hope","author_inst":"Allen Institute for AI"},{"author_name":"Jason Portenoy","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kishore Vasan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Borchardt","author_inst":"Allen Institute for AI"},{"author_name":"Eric Horvitz","author_inst":"Microsoft Research"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

Molecular epidemiology can help monitor and adapting traditional surveillance to surpass those limitations. This work aims to contrast data-driven from traditional surveillance with parameters inferred from molecular epidemiology in Latin America (LATAM) Methods: We obtained epidemiological data up to 4th June 2020. We estimated Effective Reproductive Number (Re) and epidemic curves using maximum likelihood (ML). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from GISAID up to June 4th 2020. We aligned sequences and generated ML phylogenetic tree, and ran a coalescent model Birth Death SIR. The phylodynamic analysis was performed for inferring Re, the number of infections and the date of introduction. Findings: A total of 1,144,077 cases were reported up to 4th June 2020. Countries with the largest cumulative cases were Chile, Peru and Panama. We found at least 18 different lineages circulating, with a predominance of B.1 and B.1.1. We inferred an underestimation of the daily incident cases. When contrasting observed and inferred Re, we did not find statistically significant differences except for Chile and Mexico. Temporal analysis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 suggested a detection lag of at least 21 days. Interpretation: Our results support that epidemiological and genomic surveillance are two complementary approaches. Even with a low number of genomes, proper estimations of Re could be performed. We suggest that countries, especially developing countries, should consider adding genomic surveillance to their systems for monitoring and adapting epidemiological control of SARS-CoV-2.

Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP\/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of \"genome-type clusters\" and adaptive selection of \"L\" type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the \"major group\" (52.2%) and the \"minor group\" (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations, respectively. The \"major group\" mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates.\n\nConclusionThe study highlights rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and co-circulation of multiple clades and sub-clades, driving this pandemic worldwide.

To develop a therapeutic drug for COVID-19, a model that can reproduce the viral life cycle and evaluate the drug efficacy of anti-viral drugs is essential. In this study, we established a method to generate human bronchial organoids (hBO) from commercially available cryopreserved human bronchial epithelial cells and examined whether they could be used as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research. Our hBO contain basal, club, ciliated, and goblet cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), which is an essential serine protease for priming spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, were highly expressed. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only the intracellular viral genome, but also progeny virus, cytotoxicity, pyknotic cells, and moderate increases of the type I interferon signal could be observed. Treatment with camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, reduced the viral copy number to 2% of the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile in SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO was obtained by performing RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, we succeeded in generating hBO that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 research and COVID-19 drug discovery.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/115600v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a6908org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c59300org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@362167org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb31ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tatsuya Suzuki","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yumi Ito","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Sakai","author_inst":"Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University"},{"author_name":"Akatsuki Saito","author_inst":"Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Okuzaki","author_inst":"Osaka University Research Institute for Microbial Diseases"},{"author_name":"Daisuke Motooka","author_inst":"Osaka University Research Institute for Microbial Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shohei Minami","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamamoto","author_inst":"Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Toru Okamoto","author_inst":"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Kazuo Takayama","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111013","rel_title":"Noninvasive respiratory support in acute hypoxemicrespiratory failure associated with COVID-19 and other viralinfections","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111013","rel_abs":"Introduction: Noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) have been used in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other viral infections. However, there is a lack of consensus in favor of or against NRS use due to the risks of worsening hypoxemia, intubation delay, and aerosols environmental contamination associated with the use of these tools. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the use of NRS in adult patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia (i.e. H1N1, SARS, MERS) and AHRF. We also searched for studies evaluating the risk of aerosolization\/contamination with these tools. Evidence Acquisition: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. Evidence Synthesis: The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization\/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities Conclusions: Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely. Dispersion of exhaled air is different depending on the type of respiratory therapies and interfaces.

Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cem Direkoglu","author_inst":"Middle East Technical University - Northern Cyprus Campus"},{"author_name":"Melike Sah","author_inst":"Near East University"},{"author_name":"Zeyi Zhang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jianwei Cheng","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fengjiao Ding","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Wang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Lun Xi","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuang Wang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xichong Yan","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Rongkun Zhang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fangxing Ouyang","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hui Ding","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tianyi Ke","author_inst":"Kunshan Xinyunda Biotech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.116608","rel_title":"Structure, function and variants analysis of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2, a drug target candidate for COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.116608","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus causing mainly respiratory, but also gastrointestinal symptoms. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the genetic background of an individual is responsible for the variability in clinical presentation and severity of COVID-19 is essential in understanding this disease.\n\nCell infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires binding of its Spike (S) protein to the ACE2 cell surface protein and priming of the S by the serine protease TMPRSS2. One may expect that genetic variants leading to a defective TMPRSS2 protein can affect SARS-CoV-2 ability to infect cells. We used a range of bioinformatics methods to estimate the prevalence and pathogenicity of TMPRSS2 genetic variants in the human population, and assess whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in the intestine, similarly to what is observed in lungs.\n\nWe generated a 3D structural model of the TMPRSS2 extracellular domain using the prediction server Phyre and studied 378 naturally-occurring TMPRSS2 variants reported in the GnomAD database. One common variant, p.V160M (rs12329760), is predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2 and has a MAF of 0.25. Valine 160 is a highly conserved residue within the SRCS domain. The SRCS is found in proteins involved in host defence, such as CD5 and CD6, but its role in TMPRSS2 remains unknown. 84 rare variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely truncated protein, cumulative minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.34x10-4) cause structural destabilization and possibly protein misfolding, and are also predicted damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen2 prediction tools. Moreover, we extracted gene expression data from the human protein atlas and showed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the small intestine, duodenum and colon, as well as the kidneys and gallbladder.\n\nThe implications of our study are that: i. TMPRSS2 variants, in particular p.V160M with a MAF of 0.25, should be investigated as a possible marker of disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 and ii. in vitro validation of the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastro-intestinal is warranted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessia David","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tarun Khanna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melina Beykou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gordon Hanna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael J.E.

Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e-05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labeled as a pandemic by WHO. Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model is developed to study the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of non-linear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R0 was computed. The stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increase while placing interstates individuals and foreigners under quarantine, decreases the chances of exposure and subsequent infection, leading to an increase in the recovery rate. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, help in effectively controlling the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nita H Shah","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Nisha Sheoran","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Dhairya Shukla","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nehal Shukla","author_inst":"Columbus State University"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Shukla","author_inst":"Department Of Medical Education, Piedmont Columbus Regional"},{"author_name":"Yash Shah","author_inst":"GCS Medical College"},{"author_name":"Anthony K.

This virus has caused a huge problem in the world as millions of the people are affected with this disease in the entire world. We aimed to design a peptide vaccine for COVID-19 particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes inducing the immune system and can be used later to create a new peptide vaccine that could replace conventional vaccines. A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19. We hope to confirm our findings by adding complementary steps of both in vitro and in vivo studies to support this new universal predicted candidate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renu Jakhar","author_inst":"mahrashi dayanand university"},{"author_name":"S.K GAKHAR","author_inst":"mahrashi dayanand university"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"Dhairya Shukla","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nehal Shukla","author_inst":"Columbus State University"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Shukla","author_inst":"Department Of Medical Education, Piedmont Columbus Regional"},{"author_name":"Yash Shah","author_inst":"GCS Medical College"},{"author_name":"Anthony K.

The lack of approved specific therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 associated with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to the rapid implementation and\/or randomised controlled trials of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) in many countries including the UK. Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody levels in convalescent donations. Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of large-scale collection and use of convalescent plasma. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of ELISA assays targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response. Methods. Blood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 28 days after symptom resolution. These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by microneutralisation and pseudotype assays, and for antibodies by four different ELISAs. ROC analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high neutralising antibody levels suitable for clinical use of convalescent plasma. Results. All samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%). The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun IgG ELISA S\/CO reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation co-efficient 0.88; p<0.001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13\/22). Discussion. Robust associations between virus neutralising antibody titres and reactivity in several ELISA-based antibody tests demonstrate their possible utility for scaled-up production of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"National Microbiology Services, NHS Blood and Transplant, London UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Robb","author_inst":"Statistics and Clinical Studies, NHS Blood and Transplant, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Watkins","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Cambridge, Long Road, Cambridge, CB2 0PT, UK"},{"author_name":"Samreen Ijaz","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Steven Dicks","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mokika Patel","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Pyadai Supasa","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of CRS in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here we show single cell-level mechanisms for T-cell dysregulation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby demonstrate the mechanisms underlying T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis in severe COVID-19 patients. By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 and interestingly, both the differentiation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and Th17 was inhibited. Meanwhile, highly activated CD4+ T-cells express PD-1 alongside macrophages that express PD-1 ligands in severe patients, suggesting that PD-1-mediated immunoregulation was partially operating. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD4+ T-cells, particularly CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells, produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, while activated CD4+ T-cells continue to promote further viral infection through the production of Furin. Therefore, our study proposes a new model of T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis that drives pulmonary damage, systemic CRS and organ failure in severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bahire Kalfaoglu","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Almeida-Santos","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Chanidapa Adele Tye","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yorifumi Satou","author_inst":"Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kumamoto University"},{"author_name":"Masahiro Ono","author_inst":"Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mokika Patel","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Pyadai Supasa","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Wanwisa Dejnirattisai","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Abbie Brown","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bailey","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Vipond","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Grayson","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Medicine, University of Oxford, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, ME4 4BF, UK"},{"author_name":"Jai Bolton","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Fyfe","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"High Containment Microbiology, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7BN, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig P Thompson","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim Brooks","author_inst":"Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory, Public Health England, Porton Down, UK"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Virology Reference Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, Colindale Avenue, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Gail Miflin","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant, North Bristol Park, Filton, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"David Roberts","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transplant Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9BQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ho Ko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Shen Aik","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the preprint databases MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association among inflammation level, application of ACEI\/ARB, infection severity and death in patients with COVID-19. Odd risks(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined using random-effects or fixed models depending on heterogeneity. Results: Eleven studies were included with a total of 33,483 patients. Our review showed ACEI\/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated level of immune cells(CD3, CD8). Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:0.95, 95%CI:0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI\/ARB therapy, and ACEI\/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR:0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR:0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79). Subgroup analyses showed that, among the general population, application of ACEI\/ARB therapy was associated with reduced risks of all-cause death(OR:0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.75), and the risk of severe COVID-19(OR:0.79, 95%CI: 0.60-1.05) infection and COVID-19 infection(OR:0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI\/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID-19(OR:0.73, 95%CI: 0.51-1.03) and lower mortality(OR:0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection(OR:1.00, 95%CI: 0.90-1.12). Conclusion: On the basis of the available evidence, this is the first meta-analysis showed that, in general population, the use of ACEI\/ARB therapy was safe without an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and with a decreasing trend of severe COVID-19 infection and lower mortality. In patients with hypertension, the use of ACEI\/ARB therapy should be encouraged, without increased risk of COVID-19 inflection, and better prognosis (a decreasing trends of severe COVID-19 and reduced all-cause death). Overall, ACEI\/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID-19, either in general population or hypertension patients. Our results need to be interpreted with caution considering the potential for residual confounders, and more well-designed studies that control the clinical confounders are necessary to confirm our findings.
