In the first month of COVID-19 infection, incidence of daily positive cases did follow the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) based predictions we reported in April, but started to deviate in the following months. COVID-19 transmission and disease progression depends on multifaceted determinants e.g. viral genetics, host immunity, social distancing, co-morbidity, socio-demographic and environmental parameters. Therefore deviation in confirmed cases from predicted model may appear and warrant thorough investigation. Methods: In this short report, we compared real data with SIR model and analyzed the possible factors associated with the deviation which included preventive intervention strategies, socioeconomic capabilities, climatic and meteorological indexes, acquired immunity of Bangladeshi population, demographic characteristics, health indicators and food habits. Results: The key factor responsible for the observed deviation was found to be the number of tests performed. Having population with low median age, young age groups are being mostly infected. Low prevalence of non-communicable diseases among them and strong immunity compared to the elderly might have kept most of them asymptomatic with silent recovery. Warm temperature, humidity and UV index of Bangladesh during this summer period might have contributed to the slow progression of infection. Longer daylight mediated immunity, fresh air circulations and ventilation, less population density in rural areas and certain food habits perhaps helped the large number of populations to restrict the infection up to a level. Conclusion: Despite all these helpful determinants in Bangladesh, person to person contact is still the leading risk factor for COVID-19 transmission. Infection may increase rapidly if safe distance and preventive measures are not strictly followed while resuming the normal social and work life. Expanding test capacity, strong collaborative action plans, strategies and implementation are needed immediately to prevent catastrophe.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Khulna University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Health Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117416","rel_title":"Kalman Filter Based Short Term Prediction Model for COVID-19 Spread","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117416","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has emerged as global medical emergency in recent decades. The spread scenario of this pandemic has shown many variations. Keeping all this in mind, this article is written after various studies and analysis on the latest data on COVID-19 spread, which also includes the demographic and environmental factors. After gathering data from various resources, all data are integrated and passed into different Machine Learning Models to check the fit. Ensemble Learning Technique,Random Forest, gives a good evaluation score on the test data. Through this technique, various important factors are recognised and their contribution to the spread is analysed. Also, linear relationship between various features is plotted through heatmap of Pearson Correlation matrix. Finally, Kalman Filter is used to estimate future spread of COVID19, which shows good result on test data. The inferences from Random Forest feature importance and Pearson Correlation gives many similarities and some dissimilarities, and these techniques successfully identify the different contributing factors. The Kalman Filter gives a satisfying result for short term estimation, but not so good performance for long term forecasting. Overall, the analysis, plots, inferences and forecast are satisfying and can help a lot in fighting the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr Koushlendra Kumar Singh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur"},{"author_name":"Suraj Kumar","author_inst":"National institute of Technology Jamshedpur"},{"author_name":"Prachi Dixit","author_inst":"Jai Narayan Vyas University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Dr Manish Kumar Bajpai","author_inst":"PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design Manufacturing Jabalpur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118448","rel_title":"Meta-analysis of several epidemic characteristics of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118448","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has strongly disrupted people's daily work and life, a great amount of scientific research has been conducted to understand the key characteristics of this new epidemic.

Face mask wearing is one important measure to suppress the pandemic. In order to know how efficient is face mask wearing in reducing the pandemic even with low efficiency non-professional face masks, we exploit physical abstraction to model the non-professional face masks made from cotton woven fabrics and characterize them by a parameter virus penetration rate (VPR){gamma}. Monte Carlo simulations exhibit that the effective reproduction number R of COVID-19 or similar pandemics can be approximately reduced by factor {gamma}4 with respect to the basic reproduction number R0,if the face masks with 70% <{gamma}< 90% are universally applied for the entire network. Furthermore, thought experiments and practical exploitation examples in country-level and city-level are enumerated and discussed to support our discovery in this study and indicate that the outbreak of a COVID-19 like pandemic can be even suppressed by the low efficiency non-professional face masks.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yejian Chen","author_inst":"Bell Laboratories, Nokia"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Sharon Xiangwen Xie","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dr Manish Kumar Bajpai","author_inst":"PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design Manufacturing Jabalpur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117523","rel_title":"Missing clinical trial data: the knowledge gap in the safety of potential COVID-19 drugs","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117523","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the knowledge gap in safety data by quantifying the number of missing clinical trial results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. Design: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched using the NCT number to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. Results: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. 1172 (31.2%) completed trials had tabular results on ClinicalTrials.gov. A further 1066 (28.4%) completed trials had results from the literature search, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). Conclusion: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause a large burden of additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Florence Rodgers","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Toby Pepperrell","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarai Keestra","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Anthropology & Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, UK   2.\tDepartment of Global Health & Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical M"},{"author_name":"Victoria Pilkington","author_inst":"Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire Healthcare Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20117168","rel_title":"Using newspapers obituaries to nowcast daily mortality: evidence from the Italian COVID-19 hot-spots","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20117168","rel_abs":"Real-time tracking of infectious disease outbreaks helps policymakers to make timely data-driven decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To develop, externally validate and prospectively test a transparent deep learning algorithm for predicting 24 hours in advance the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational cohort study SETTING: Two academic medical centers from January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2019 (Retrospective cohorts) and February 10, 2020 to May 4, 2020 (Prospective cohorts). PARTICIPANTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the intensive care units (ICUs) at two hospitals. Additionally, 777 patients with COVID-19 patients were used for prospective validation. Patients who were placed on mechanical ventilation within four hours of their admission were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME(S) and MEASURE(S): Electronic health record (EHR) data were extracted on an hourly basis, and a set of 40 features were calculated and passed to an interpretable deep-learning algorithm to predict the future need for mechanical ventilation 24 hours in advance. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (based on heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, FiO2 and pH) was used to assess future need for mechanical ventilation. Performance of the algorithms were evaluated using the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, the external validation cohort included 3,888 general ICU and 402 COVID-19 patients. The performance of the model (AUC) with a 24-hour prediction horizon at the validation site was 0.882 for the general ICU population and 0.918 for patients with COVID-19. In comparison, commonly used clinical criteria and the ROX score achieved AUCs in the range of 0.773 - 0.782 and 0.768 - 0.810 for the general ICU population and patients with COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS and RELEVANCE: A generalizable and transparent deep-learning algorithm improves on traditional clinical criteria to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians with optimizing timing of tracheal intubation, better allocation of mechanical ventilation resources and staff, and improve patient care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Supreeth P.

Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, it is essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling. Methods: A COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number (R_0, a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to R_0. Results: The estimated basic reproduction number is R_0=4.63, which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission (R_1=2.42), the contaminated environment also played a significant role. Conclusions: It is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19 disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in infection transmission is also important in this regard.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sujata Saha","author_inst":"Mankar College"},{"author_name":"Sumanta Saha","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Paulina Paul","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Morgan Carlile","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Laura N.

We first quantified the heterogeneity of viral dynamics which could be a confounder in compassionate use programs. Second, we demonstrated that an antiviral drug is unlikely to be effective if initiated after a short period following symptom onset. For accurate evaluation of the efficacy of an antiviral drug for COVID-19, antiviral treatment should be initiated before or soon after symptom onset in randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan;"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Ejima","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Kwang Su Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan;"},{"author_name":"Koji Noshita","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasuhisa Fujita","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Taiga Miyazaki","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shigeru Kohno","author_inst":"Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshitsugu Miyazaki","author_inst":"Department of chemotherapy & mycoses, and Leprosy Research Ctr., National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo,"},{"author_name":"Shimpei Morimoto","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shinji Nakaoka","author_inst":"Faculty of Advanced Life Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiyuki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Asai","author_inst":"Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"International Research Center for Neurointelligence, The University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"Christ Church, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 1DP, UK"},{"author_name":"Kenji Shibuya","author_inst":"Institute for Population Health, Kings College London, London"},{"author_name":"Katsuhito Fujiu","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Iwami Shingo","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118349","rel_title":"Covid-19 and Population Age Structure","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118349","rel_abs":"Epidemiological studies suggest that age distribution of a population has a non-trivial effect on how morbidity rates, mortality rates and case fatality rates (CFR) vary when there is an epidemic or pandemic.

This study focuses specifically on the efficacy of stay-at-home orders, both nationally and internationally, in the control of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis from April to May 2020 and included countries and US states with known stay-at-home orders. Our primary exposure was the time between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 to an implemented stay-at-home mandate for each region. Our primary outcomes were the time from the first reported case to the highest number of daily cases and daily deaths. We conducted simple linear regression analyses, controlling for the case rate of the outbreak. RESULTS: For US states and countries, a larger number of days between the first reported case and stay-at-home mandates was associated with a longer time to reach the peak daily case and death counts. The largest effect was among regions classified as the latest 10% to implement a mandate, which in the US, predicted an extra 35.3 days to the peak number of cases (95 % CI: 18.2, 52.5), and 38.3 days to the peak number of deaths (95 % CI: 23.6, 53.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the potential beneficial effect of earlier stay-at-home mandates, by shortening the time to peak case and death counts for US states and countries. Regions in which mandates were implemented late experienced a prolonged duration to reaching both peak daily case and death counts.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Medline, MPH","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lamar Hayes, MPH","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Farnoosh Vahedi","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katia Valdez","author_inst":"Fielding School of Public Health, University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jake Sonnenberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Will Capell","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ami Hayashi","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zoe Glick","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

The resultant cytokines were then analyzed for their interrelationships and fluctuating features in sequential samples from 38 COVID-19 patients. Three cytokines, M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF, which were clustered into 3 different correlation groups and had relatively small fluctuations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, were selected for the construction of a multiclass classification model. This model discriminated healthy individuals and asymptomatic and nonsevere patients with accuracy of 77.4% but was not successful in classifying severe patients. Further searching led to a single cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which classified severe from nonsevere COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 97.9% under a cutoff value of 1128 pg\/ml. The level of this cytokine did not increase in nonsevere patients but was significantly elevated in severe patients. Considering its potent antiinflammatory function, we suggest that HGF might be a new candidate therapy for critical COVID-19. In addition, our new strategy provides not only a rational and effective way to focus on certain cytokine biomarkers for infectious diseases but also a new opportunity to probe the modulation of cytokines in the immune response.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hai-Jun Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan-Xin Long","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Bei-Zhong Liu","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-Hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Pu Liao","author_inst":"Laboratory department, Chongqing People Hospital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yin-Yin Xu","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhan Mo","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jieli Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Infectious Diseases designated by the Chinese Ministry of"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"Christ Church, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 1DP, UK"},{"author_name":"Kenji Shibuya","author_inst":"Institute for Population Health, Kings College London, London"},{"author_name":"Katsuhito Fujiu","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Iwami Shingo","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117721","rel_title":"A comparative evaluation of dye-based and probe-based RT-qPCR assay for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 using individual and pooled-sample testing.","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117721","rel_abs":"Effective interventions are mandatory to control the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious virus causing devastating effects worldwide. Cost-effective approaches are pivotal tools required to increase the detection rates and escalate further in massive surveillance programs, especially in countries with limited resources that most of the efforts have focused on symptomatic cases only. Here, we compared the performance of the RT-qPCR using an intercalating dye with the probe-based assay. Then, we tested and compared these two RT-qPCR chemistries in different pooling systems: after RNA extraction (post-RNA extraction) and before RNA extraction (pre-RNA extraction) optimizing by pool size and template volume. We evaluated these approaches in 610 clinical samples. Our results show that the dye-based technique has a high analytical sensitivity similar to the probe-based detection assay used worldwide. Further, this assay may also be applicable in testing by pool systems post-RNA extraction up to 20 samples. However, the most efficient system for massive surveillance, the pre-RNA extraction pooling approach, was obtained with the probe-based assay in test up to 10 samples adding 13.5 uL of RNA template. The low cost and the potential use in pre-RNA extraction pool systems, place of this assays as a valuable resource for scalable sampling to larger populations. Implementing a pool system for population sampling results in an important savings of laboratory resources and time, which are two key factors during an epidemic outbreak. Using the pooling approaches evaluated here, we are confident that it can be used as a valid alternative assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human samples.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Verdugo","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Anita Plaza","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Acosta-Jamett","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Natalia Castro","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Josefina Gutierrez","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carlos Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carmen Lopez-Joven","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carlos Loncoman","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Claudio Navarrete","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Ramirez-Reveco","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Alex Romero","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silva","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Matias Vega","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Cristobal Verdugo","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Vergara","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Kenji Shibuya","author_inst":"Institute for Population Health, Kings College London, London"},{"author_name":"Katsuhito Fujiu","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Iwami Shingo","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117937","rel_title":"Repurposed prophylaxis strategies for COVID-19: a systematic review","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117937","rel_abs":"Introduction Efficient therapeutic strategies are needed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS- CoV-2 virus.

We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a large public hospital in France. Method: It is a single centre retrospective observational cohort. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients who had signs of respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, despite receiving 10 to 15 l\/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, were treated by CPAP with a face-mask unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. The main outcomes under study were reasons for CPAP discontinuation and mortality. Results: A total of 585 patients were admitted in Delafontaine hospital for severe COVID-19. ICU was quickly overwhelmed. Fifty-nine out of 159 (37%) patients requiring ICU care had to be referred to other hospitals. CPAP therapy was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). SARS-CoV2 pneumonia was confirmed by PCR from respiratory tract in 39 (79%) patients and by thoracic CT scan in the remaining patients. CPAP was performed out of ICU in 41 (84%) cases. Median age was 65 years (IQR=54-71). Median duration of CPAP treatment was 3 days (IQR=1-5). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were intubation for invasive ventilation in 25 (51%) patients, improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%). A decision not to intubate had been taken for the 2 patients who died while on CPAP. Conclusions: Treatment with CPAP is feasible and safe in a non-ICU environment in the context of a massive influx of patients. One third of these patients with high oxygen requirements did not eventually need invasive ventilation.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Alviset","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Quentin Riller","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Jerome Aboab","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Kelly Dilworth","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"Pierre Alain Billy","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Yannis Lombardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Azzi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20118125","rel_title":"Reduction in stroke patients' referral to the ED in the COVID-19 era: A four-year comparative study","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20118125","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction. Current reports indicate that the increased use of social distancing for preventive COID-19 distribution may have a negative effect on patients who suffering from acute medical conditions. Aim. We examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients' referral to the emergency department (ED) Method. A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS, number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or combine) and in-hospital death. Results. The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of final AIS diagnosis for the year of 2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the highest diagnosis rate demarcated for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed patients. The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the examined years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47). Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in routing constraints on health care system resources that were dedicated for treating COVID-19 patients. The healthcare system must develop and offer complementary solutions that will enable access to health services even during these difficult times.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mor Saban","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Anna Reznik","author_inst":"Rambam health care campus"},{"author_name":"Tal Shachar","author_inst":"Bar Ilan university"},{"author_name":"Rotem Sivan-Hoffmann III","author_inst":"Rambam health care campus"},{"author_name":"Pierre Alain Billy","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Yannis Lombardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Azzi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118893","rel_title":"The COVID-19 Pandemic in Africa: Predictions using the SIR Model Indicate the Cases are Falling","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118893","rel_abs":"Since the earliest reports of the Coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the disease has rapidly spread worldwide, attaining pandemic levels in early March 2020. However, the spread of COVID-19 has differed in the African setting compared to countries on other continents. To predict the spread of COVID-19 in Africa and within each country on the continent, we applied a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model. Here, our results show that, overall, Africa is currently (May 29, 2020) at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, after which we predict the number of cases would begin to fall in June 2020. Furthermore, we predict that the ending phase of the pandemic would be in Mid-August 2020 and that decreasing cases of COVID-19 infections would be detected until around December 2020 and January 2021. Our results also reveal that of the 51 countries with reported COVID-19 cases, only nine, including South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia, are likely to report higher monthly COVID-19 cases in June 2020 than those reported in the previous months. Overall, at the end of this pandemic, we predict that approximately 279,000 (about 154,000 future cases) individuals in Africa would have been infected with the COVID-19 virus. Here, our predictions are data-driven and based on the previously observed trends in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shifts in the population dynamics and\/or changes in the infectiousness of the COVID-19 virus may require new forecasts of the disease spread.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Musalula Sinkala","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Panji Nkhoma","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Mildred Zulu","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Doris Kafita","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Rabecca Tembo","author_inst":"University of Zambia"},{"author_name":"Victor Daka","author_inst":"Copperbelt University"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Azzi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118372","rel_title":"Modelling Singapore COVID-19 pandemic with a SEIR multiplex network model","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118372","rel_abs":"In this paper, we have implemented a large-scale agent-based model to study the outbreak of coronavirus infectious diseases (COVID-19) in Singapore, taking into account complex human interaction pattern.

Due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity, combined with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under-reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy, the focus of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a generalized SEIRD model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures, and (ii) to estimate the response of the COVID-19 spread dynamics to perturbations\/uncertainties. By investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, as well as the effective reproduction number, we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak. Due to such importance in the outcomes, different relaxation strategies of social distancing measures are investigated in order to determine which strategies are viable and less hazardous to the population. The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases. An even worse scenario could occur if the quarantine relaxation policy is implemented before evidence of the epidemiological control, indicating the importance of the proper choice of when to start relaxing social distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Tavares Volpatto","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Anna Claudia Mello Resende","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Lucas Anjos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Joao Vitor Oliveira Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Claudia Mazza Dias","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Regina Cerqueira Almeida","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mara Cardoso Malta","author_inst":"Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.122671","rel_title":"Optimized pseudotyping conditions for the SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.122671","rel_abs":"The SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein is solely responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, MLV, and VSV particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Spike. Infection of 293FT target cells was only possible if the cells were engineered to stably express the human ACE-2 receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5-10 fold. Substitution of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modification of a single amino acid in the furin cleavage site of Spike (R682Q) enhanced infectious particle production another 10-fold. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped particles reached almost 106 infectious particles\/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike was successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients, but not plasma from uninfected individuals.\n\nImportanceWhen working with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high titer SARS-COV2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc C Johnson","author_inst":"University of Missouri, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Terri D Lyddon","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Reinier Suarez","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Braxton Salcedo","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Mary LePique","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Maddie Graham","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Clifton L Ricana","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Carolyn A Robinson","author_inst":"University of Missouri"},{"author_name":"Detlef G Ritter","author_inst":"University of Missouri Health System"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.122986","rel_title":"Risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data, signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 {+\/-} 13.1 vs. 62.8 {+\/-} 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population. Further studies in are needed to complete and confirm our findings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Iftime","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Ana  F L\u00f3pez-Azcona","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Manuel Vicente-Miralles","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Ramon Descarrega-Reina","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Anna Hern\u00e1ndez-Aguilera","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Francesc Riu","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Josep  M Sim\u00f3","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Pedro Garrido","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Jorge Joven","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Jordi Camps","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus"},{"author_name":"Antoni Castro","author_inst":"HUSJR"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117366","rel_title":"When \"Shelter-in-Place\" Isn't Shelter That's Safe: A Rapid Analysis of Domestic Violence Case Differences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Stay-at-Home Orders","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117366","rel_abs":"Purpose: This study explored the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts on domestic violence (DV) with the following research questions: 1) Did DV occurring during the pandemic differ on certain variables from cases occurring on a typical day the previous year? 2) Did DV occurring after the implementation of shelter-in-place orders differ (on these same variables) from cases occurring prior to shelter-in-place orders? Methods: Two logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N=4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-in-place period later that month. Results: Both models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 20% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-in-place period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred. Conclusions: This study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Molly M.
