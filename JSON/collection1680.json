To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1\/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.\n\nAuthor summaryEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachana Banerjee","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Kausik Basak","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Anamika Ghosh","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Vyshakh Rajachandran","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Kamakshi Sureka","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Debabani Ganguly","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Sujay Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies & Research Kolkata"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.255810","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Depends on Heparan Sulfates and Is Blocked by Low Molecular Weight Heparins","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.255810","rel_abs":"The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and new outbreaks worldwide highlight the need for preventive treatments. Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed by epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization. These results have imperative implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal an important target for novel prophylactic intervention.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Bermejo-Jambrina","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Julia Eder","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Tanja M Kaptein","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Leanne C Helgers","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Philip J Brouwer","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"John L van Hamme","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Alexander P Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Frank E.H.P van Baarle","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Godelieve J de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Bernadien Maartje Nijmeijer","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centres, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Neeltje A Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Marit J van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rogier W Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Teunis B.H.

Here, using single cell RNA-seq, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients, and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DC) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8+ T cell subsets, compared to health controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4+ T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2 and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients' peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4 and CCL5 etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the patients' lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Furong Qi","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Hanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoju Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Ido Amit","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175067","rel_title":"A pilot study to see any Change of the Nasal and Oropharyngeal Microbiota with Prolonged Use of Medical Masks during the COVID-19 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175067","rel_abs":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has played havoc on the healthcare system and society. Many international guidelines have put forward various measures to control the spread and, using various quality masks seems to be the most important amongst them. This was a cross-sectional pilot study to see any alterations in the bacterial flora of the nasal and the oropharyngeal (OP) microbiota with the use of medical masks over prolonged periods during this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected using proper international guidelines from 30 healthy healthcare workers matching pre-set inclusion criteria, who gave written informed consent. The swabs were used for gram stain as well as culture and sensitivity analysis using standard methods. Results: In general, we found that the oropharyngeal microflora harboured a more diverse population of bacteria (n=13) than the nasal microflora (n=5). The predominant bacterial flora was found to Staphylococcus epidermidis in the nasal cavity and Streptococcus viridans in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was no growth in 8 (26.68%) samples of oropharynx and 3 (10%) of nasal samples, with one patient having no growth in both the samples. The commonest resistant antibiotic from both the cavity cultures was benzylpenicillin (nasal flora 80% and OP flora 47.37%). Conclusion: This small pilot study has shown a reassuring aspect of no change in the typical bacterial microflora species of the nasal and OP cavity with prolonged use of medical masks. This is the first study to show this convincing evidence during the COVID-19 outbreak and also in healthy healthcare workers who have to wear masks over long durations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayak Roy","author_inst":"Medica Superspeciality Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pampi Majumder","author_inst":"Suraksha Diagnostic Pvt.

Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests since these were limited in numbers initially. Additionally, their intent was as a diagnostic rather than a surveying tool. By September 17, the United States' cumulative recovered population is estimated at 45% or 149 million. The remaining susceptible population is 55%, or 50%, excepting the currently infected 5% population. The estimated mortality rate of the cumulative total affected population is 0.13% death. States have followed diverse epidemic time courses. New Jersey and New York show SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 95% and 82%, respectively. Likewise, each state exhibits relatively low current positive PCR results at 1.2 % and 0.8%. Also, these states show about twice the mortality rate of the nation. By comparison, Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered populations percent around 50%, and higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 5% to 9%. This novel approach provides an improved source of information on the pandemic's full-time course in terms of precision and accuracy in contrast to serological testing, which only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease. The deficiency of serological testing to estimate the recovered population is made even more acute due to the large proportion of asymptomatic and sub-clinical cases in the COVID-19 pandemic (2,3). T-cell testing, reputedly capable of long-term detection of previously infected individuals, will provide a complete view of the recovered population when it becomes available for large scale use. This New Hospital Admission based method informs a more effective and efficient deployment of a vaccination program since it provides not only a reliable estimate of the susceptible population by state, but it can also provide visibility down to the county level based on COVID-19 hospitalization record independent of PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose E Gonzalez","author_inst":"Aletheia Analytics LLC"},{"author_name":"Pampi Majumder","author_inst":"Suraksha Diagnostic Pvt.

This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example. Methodology\/Principal Findings Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables. For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state, Conclusions\/Significance The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cho Naing","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Han Ni","author_inst":"SEGi University, Sibu Clinical Campus, Sarawak, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Htar Htar Aung","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Elaine Chan Wan Ling","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Joon Wah Mak","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoju Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Ido Amit","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175513","rel_title":"Behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal products among the public in response to Covid-19 in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175513","rel_abs":"The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods\/products among the public in response to Covid-19.

Our objective was to perform case detection of an entire rural community to quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission using PCR and antibody testing. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural town of Bolinas, California (population 1,620), four weeks following shelter-in-place orders. Residents and county essential workers were tested between April 20th-24th, 2020. Prevalence by PCR and seroprevalence combining data from two forms of antibody testing were performed in parallel (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG to nucleocapsid protein and in-house IgG ELISA to the receptor binding domain). Results: Of 1,891 participants, 1,312 were confirmed Bolinas residents (>80% community ascertainment). Zero participants were PCR positive. Assuming 80% sensitivity, it would have been unlikely to observe these results (p<0.05) if there were >3 active infections in the community. Based on antibody results, estimated prevalence of prior infection was 0.16% (95% CrI: 0.02%, 0.46%). Seroprevalence estimates using only one of the two tests would have been higher, with greater uncertainty. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive result on both tests was 99.11% (95% CrI: 95.75%, 99.94%), compared to PPV 44.19%-63.32% (95% CrI range 3.25%-98.64%) if only one test was utilized. Conclusions: Four weeks following shelter-in-place, active and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rural Northern California community was extremely rare.

Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals.

Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katharina R\u00f6ltgen","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver F Wirz","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bryan A Stevens","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abigail E Powell","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Hogan","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Javaria Najeeb","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Molly Hunter","author_inst":"ATUM"},{"author_name":"Malaya K Sahoo","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"ChunHong Huang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fumiko Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Manalac","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana R Otrelo-Cardoso","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tho D Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175844","rel_title":"IL-6 and IL-10 as predictors of disease severity in COVID 19 patients: Results from Meta-analysis and Regression","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175844","rel_abs":"Objectives: SARS-CoV-2, an infectious agent behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, induces high levels of cytokines in patients contributing to the disease patho-physiology. Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of particular cytokines towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical management. Methods: Scientific literature was searched to identify 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN-{gamma} between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. Results: Out of the 6 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across the studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~ 92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates. Conclusions: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sujan K Dhar","author_inst":"Beyond Antibody"},{"author_name":"Vishnupriyan K","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sharat Damodar","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shashi Gujar","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Manjula Das","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Javaria Najeeb","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Molly Hunter","author_inst":"ATUM"},{"author_name":"Malaya K Sahoo","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"ChunHong Huang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fumiko Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Manalac","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana R Otrelo-Cardoso","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tho D Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20172080","rel_title":"Evaluation of commercially available immuno-magnetic agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for rapid point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20172080","rel_abs":"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Fast, accurate and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. Methods: The study included 35 plasma samples from 22 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgA or IgG antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA)(ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM+IgA\/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics, Denmark) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ((ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Germany). Results: Of the 35 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 29 (82.9%) were positive for IgA\/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples (82.9%) were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA+IgM and 73% IgG by IMA and 73% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 90%. Specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. Conclusion: IMA for COVID-19 is a rapid simple-to-use point of care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Engel Moeller","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Fock","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Pearlyn Pah","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Antia De La Campa Veras","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Melanie Bade","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Marco Donolato","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Simone Bastrup Israelsen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jesper Eugen-Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Benfield","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Frederik Neess Engsig","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Justin Manalac","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana R Otrelo-Cardoso","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tho D Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175455","rel_title":"Specific Dynamic Variations in the Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Subsets in COVID-19 and Severe Influenza A Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175455","rel_abs":"Background: Both COVID-19 and influenza A contribute to increased mortality among the elderly and those with existing comorbidities.

Methods: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). Results: We reviewed the patients' data of 110 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe COVID-19, 19 Severe COVID-19 and 43 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.93*109\/L, 0.84*109\/L vs 1.78*109\/L, P < 0.0001) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of both severe patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1-4).

To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R square value of 78.6%. Findings from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation and would help to develop policies aimed to prevent the future epidemic crisis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarissa M.

While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Non-severe cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors. Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P <.008). In 10.7% (978\/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65\/305) of cases. Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Askin Gulsen","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Burcu Arpinar Yigitbas","author_inst":"Yedikule Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Berat Uslu","author_inst":"Yedikule Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Daniel Droemann","author_inst":"Deparment ofPneumology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oguz Kilinc","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Rania M El-Lababidi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Fadi Hamed","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Abuzakouk","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud El-Kaissi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ma","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianwei Zhao","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaodi Guo","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20175752","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine Safety Outcome within Approved Therapeutic Protocol for COVID-19 Outpatients in Saudi Arabia","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20175752","rel_abs":"Background: Healthcare systems globally has been challenged following the COVID-19 pandemic, since late 2019. Multiple approaches and strategies have been performed to relieve the pressure and support existing healthcare systems. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the National Healthcare System. Since the 5th of June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics were established across Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 2,733 eligible patients subjected to MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine and zinc) and revisited the clinics within 3-7 days after treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. The data was collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with that of the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network, HESN) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) Committee. Results: Majority of the cases were males (70.4%). Upon reassessing the studied participants within 3-7 days, 240 patients (8.8%) discontinued the treatment protocol because of the development of side effects (4.1%) and for non-clinical reasons in the remaining (4.7%). Medication side effects overall were reported among (6.7%) of all studied participants, including mainly cardiovascular adverse events (2.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (2.4%). No Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death were reported among these patients. Conclusion: In our study, results show that the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients in mild to moderate cases in an outpatient setting, within the protocol recommendation and inclusion\/exclusion criteria, is safe, highly tolerable, and with minimum side effects.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdulrhman Mohana","author_inst":"Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tarek Suliman","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nagla Mahmoud","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Hassanein","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Amel Alfaifi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Eissa Alenazi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nashwa Radwan","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nasser Alkhalifah","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ehab Elkady","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Almohaizeie","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AbdulKareem","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Hani Jokhdar","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad Alrabiah","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20175356","rel_title":"SARS-Coronavirus-2 nucleocapsid protein measured in blood using a Simoa ultra-sensitive immunoassay differentiates COVID-19 infection with high clinical sensitivity.","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20175356","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies and economies worldwide. Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum \/ plasma samples. The limit of detection (LoD) estimated by titration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.2 pg\/ml, corresponding to 0.05 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) per ml, > 2000 times more sensitive than current EUA approved antigen tests. No cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses, including hCoV229E, hCoVOC43, hCoVNL63, Influenza A or Influenza B, was observed. We detected elevated N-protein concentrations in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals using capillary blood from a finger-stick collection device. The Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay has the potential to detect COVID-19 infection via antigen in blood with similar or better performance characteristics of molecular tests, while also enabling at home and point of care sample collection.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dandan Shan","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Johnson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Syrena C Fernandes","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Muriel Mendes","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hannah Suib","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Marcella Holdridge","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Elaine M Burke","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Katie G Beauregard","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Megan Cleary","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samantha Xu","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yao","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Purvish P Patel","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Plavina","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"David H Wilson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim M Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Jacob Natterman","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn, and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF),"},{"author_name":"Susanne V Schmidt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Eicke Latz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn and German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.15.20175588","rel_title":"A data-driven epidemiological model to explain the Covid-19 pandemic in multiple countries and help in choosing mitigation strategies","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.15.20175588","rel_abs":"Accurate models are fundamental to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate different mitigation strategies.

Design We used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020. Methods The survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences. Findings More than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions Only 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society. Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience\/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings. Clinical Relevance Providing insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuela Hoedl","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Doris Eglseer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bauer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Joana Goncalves-Sa","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I\/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lulu Han","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Meng-Wei Zhuang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Mei-Ling Nan","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Chengjiang Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity of Shandong Province, Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong"},{"author_name":"Katie G Beauregard","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Megan Cleary","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Samantha Xu","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yao","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Purvish P Patel","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Plavina","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"David H Wilson","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim M Kaiser","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Jacob Natterman","author_inst":"Institute of Innate Immunity, University of Bonn, and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF),"},{"author_name":"Susanne V Schmidt","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Eicke Latz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn and German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.252676","rel_title":"A lesson from COVID-19 on inaccessibility of web-based information for disabled populations worldwide","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.252676","rel_abs":"Many government websites and mobile content are inaccessible for people with vision, hearing, and cognitive disabilities.

Although some public clones could be explained by antibody convergence, public clones in naive repertoire or virus-neutralizing clones from not infected people were also discovered. All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals. Our result demonstrated that these clones are predisposed in the human antibody repertoire and may exert critical functions during particular immunological stimuli and consequently benefit the donors. We also implemented RAPID - a Rep-seq Analysis Platform with Integrated Databases, which may serve as a useful tool for others in the field.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanfang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Qingxian Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Huikun Zeng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Minhui Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Yanxia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujia Yang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaqi Wu","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Chengrui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxi Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Cuiyu Ma","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Guan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Shixin Guo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Sen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Changqing Chang","author_inst":"Integrate Microbiology Research Center, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.253682","rel_title":"Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells and genomic mutational analysis of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.253682","rel_abs":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1\/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nehemya Friedman","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Jacob-Hirsch","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Yaron Drori","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Eran Eyal","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Nitzan Kol","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Omri Nayshool","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Ella Mendelson","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Gidi Rechavi","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer"},{"author_name":"Michal Mandelboim","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chengrui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Wenxi Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Cuiyu Ma","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Guan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Shixin Guo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Sen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Changqing Chang","author_inst":"Integrate Microbiology Research Center, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174961","rel_title":"Rates of COVID-19-related Outcomes in Cancer compared to non-Cancer Patients","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174961","rel_abs":"Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection.

Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lova Sun","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Surya Sanjna","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anh Le","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Heena Desai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Abigail Doucette","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Peter Gabriel","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Marylyn Ritchie","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rader","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ivan Maillard","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Erin Bange","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alexander Huang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Robert H Vonderheide","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Angela DeMichele","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anurag Verma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ronac Mamtani","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kara N Maxwell","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lai Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen Univer"},{"author_name":"Zhenhai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hrusovsky","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Dawn Mattoon","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Ball","author_inst":"Quanterix Corporation"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.14.20174805","rel_title":"The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark","rel_date":"2020-08-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.14.20174805","rel_abs":"Objective: Early identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.
