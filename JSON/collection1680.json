Herein, we describe and apply a rapid, sensitive, and accurate virus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The new assay is based on an HIV-1 lentiviral vector that contains a secreted intron Gaussia luciferase or secreted Nano-luciferase reporter cassette, pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, and is validated with a plaque reduction assay using an authentic, infectious SARS-CoV-2 strain. The new assay was used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum from individuals with a broad range of COVID-19 symptoms, including intensive care unit (ICU) patients, health care workers (HCWs), and convalescent plasma donors. The highest neutralizing antibody titers were observed among ICU patients, followed by general hospitalized patients, HCWs and convalescent plasma donors. Our study highlights a wide phenotypic variation in human antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrates the efficacy of a novel lentivirus pseudotype assay for high-throughput serological surveys of neutralizing antibody titers in large cohorts.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cong Zeng","author_inst":"Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"John P Evans","author_inst":"Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Pearson","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Panke Qu","author_inst":"Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Min Zheng","author_inst":"Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard T Robinson","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Luanne Hall-Stoodley","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Yount","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Sonal Pannu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Rama K Mallampalli","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Linda Saif","author_inst":"Food Animal Health Research Program, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences; Viruses and E"},{"author_name":"Eugene Oltz","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Gerard Lozanski","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Shan-Lu Liu","author_inst":"Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program, In"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166587","rel_title":"Peripheral innate and adaptive immune cells during COVID-19: Functional neutrophils, pro-inflammatory monocytes and half-dead lymphocytes","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166587","rel_abs":"A better understanding of the innate and adaptive cells in the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a necessity for the development of effective treatment methods and vaccines. We studied phenotypic features of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative burst, phagocytosis and apoptosis. One hundred and three patients with COVID-19 grouped according to their clinical features as mild (35%), moderate (40.8%), and severe (24.3%) were included in the study. Monocytes from all COVID-19 patients were CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes. Neutrophils were mature and functional. No defect has been found in ROS production of monocytes and neutrophils as well as no defect in their apoptosis. As bridging cells of the innate and adaptive immune system; the percentage of NK cells was in normal range whereas the percentages of CD3-CD8+CD56+ innate lymphoid and CD3+CD56+ NK like T cells were found to be high in the severe cases of COVID-19. Although absolute numbers of all lymphocyte subsets were low and showed a tendency for a gradual decrease in accord with the disease progression, in all COVID-19 patients, the lymphocyte subset with the most decreased absolute number was B lymphocytes, followed by CD4 + T cells in the severe cases. The percentages of suppressive, CD3+CD4-CD8-; HLA-DR+CD3+ and CD28-CD8+ cells were found to be significantly increased. Importantly, we demonstrated spontaneous caspase-3 activation and increased lymphocyte apoptosis. Altogether our data suggest that SARS-CoV- 2 primarily affects lymphocytes not innate cells.

Yet many of these are expensive, in limited supply, and not necessarily validated specifically for viral RNA. While saliva is a promising sample type as it can be reliably self-collected for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, the expense and availability of these collection tubes are prohibitive to mass testing efforts. Therefore, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus detection from saliva without supplementation. We tested RNA stability over extended periods of time (2-25 days) and at temperatures representing at-home storage and elevated temperatures which might be experienced when cold chain transport may be unavailable. We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva from infected individuals is stable at 4{degrees}C, room temperature (~19{degrees}C), and 30{degrees}C for prolonged periods and found limited evidence for viral replication in saliva. This work demonstrates that expensive saliva collection options involving RNA stabilization and virus inactivation buffers are not always needed, permitting the use of cheaper collection options. Affordable testing methods are urgently needed to meet current testing demands and for continued surveillance in reopening strategies.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel M Ott","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Madison S Strine","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne E Watkins","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Maikel Boot","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Chaney C Kalinich","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina A Harden","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

The fatality trajectory represented by this trend line can be projected from the number of daily infections by assuming a time lapse between symptom onset and death between 17 and 19 days and a nominal time-dependent fatality rate. The time trajectory of this fatality rate suggests a change of the infection dynamics at April 3, with an increase from 2.5% to 6% within 20 days perhaps indicating spread of infection to more vulnerable people. Later in summer, the nominal fatality rate decreases down to 1% in mid-July raising the question whether Covid-19 is intrinsically less lethal in summer. Although the time trajectories of infections and fatality are pronouncedly different, the reproduction rates obtained therefrom are similar indicating that the infection dynamics may reasonably well be deduced from the potentially biased reported infection rate if it is biased consistently, i.e. the same way, over an extended period of time. The administrative measures to contain the pandemic seem not to have an immediate effect on the infection dynamics but well the ease of restrictions. An effect of mask wearing on decreasing lethality cannot be excluded.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dieter Mergel","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, Faculty of Physics"},{"author_name":"Madison S Strine","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne E Watkins","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Maikel Boot","author_inst":"Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Chaney C Kalinich","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina A Harden","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission\/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission\/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. Method: We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Findings: Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and\/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 30% in daily cases. Interpretation: The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and\/or preferential vaccination plans (when available). Funding: None.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Sudipta Dey Tirtha","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Naveen Chandra Iraganaboina","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Naveen Eluru","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Chaney C Kalinich","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina A Harden","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

Their risk of hospitalisation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and that of their households, is poorly understood. Design and settings and participants: During the peak period for COVID-19 infection in Scotland (1st March 2020 to 6th June 2020) we conducted a national record linkage study to compare the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among healthcare workers (age: 18-65 years), their households and other members of the general population. Main outcome: Hospitalisation with COVID-19 Results: The cohort comprised 158,445 healthcare workers, the majority being patient facing (90,733 \/ 158,445; 57.3%), and 229,905 household members. Of all COVID-19 hospitalisations in the working age population (18-65-year-old), 17.2% (360 \/ 2,097) were in healthcare workers or their households. Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population (hazards ratio [HR] 0.81; 95%CI 0.52-1.26 and 0.86; 95%CI 0.49-1.51 respectively). In models adjusting for the same covariates however, patient facing healthcare workers, compared to non-patient facing healthcare workers, were at higher risk (HR 3.30; 95%CI 2.13-5.13); so too were household members of patient facing healthcare workers (HR 1.79; 95%CI 1.10-2.91). On sub-dividing patient-facing healthcare workers into those who worked in front-door, intensive care and non-intensive care aerosol generating settings and other, those in front door roles were at higher risk (HR 2.09; 95%CI 1.49-2.94). For most patient facing healthcare workers and their households, the estimated absolute risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation was less than 0.5% but was 1% and above in older men with comorbidity. Conclusions: Healthcare workers and their households contribute a sixth of hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Whilst the absolute risk of hospitalisation was low overall, patient facing healthcare workers and their households had 3- and 2-fold increased risks of COVID-19 hospitalisation.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Ciara Gribben","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"David Caldwell","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Bishop","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Amanda Weir","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Kennedy","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Martin Reid","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Health protection scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Fischbacher","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA; Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167122","rel_title":"Ethnic minority groups in England and Wales - factors affecting the size and timing of elevated COVID-19 mortality: a retrospective cohort study linking Census and death records","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167122","rel_abs":"Objectives: To estimate population-level associations between ethnicity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality, and to investigate how ethnicity-specific mortality risk evolved over the course of the pandemic.

For males, COVID-19 mortality risk remained elevated for the Black (1.76 [1.63 to 1.90]), Bangladeshi\/Pakistani (1.35 [1.21 to 1.49]) and Indian (1.30 [1.19 to 1.43]) groups. The HRs decreased after lockdown for all ethnic groups, particularly Black and Bangladeshi\/Pakistani females. Conclusions: Differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups were largely attenuated by geographical and socio-economic factors, although some residual differences remained. Lockdown was associated with reductions in excess mortality risk in ethnic minority populations, which has major implications for a second wave of infection or local spikes. Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms underpinning observed differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Ayoubkhani","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Vahe Nafilyan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Chris White","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Peter Goldblatt","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Health Equity"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Gaughan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Louisa Blackwell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Nicky Rogers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Myer Glickman","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA; Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167254","rel_title":"Review of Forecasting Models for Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic in India during Country-wise Lockdown","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167254","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is spreading widely across the globe right now. Majority of the countries are relying on models and studies such as stochastic simulations, AceMod model, neural networks-based models, exponential growth model,Weibull distribution model, and so on to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming months. The objective on utilizing these models is to ensure that strict measures can be enacted to contain the virus spread and also predict the resources required to deal with the pandemic as the disease spreads. In the past few months, several models were used to predict the infection rate for COVID-19. These models predicted the infection rates, recovery rate or death rates for the COVID-19 patients. All these different models took different approaches and different scenarios to predict the future rates. Now, that we know the real cases, we can check how accurate these models were. Some of these models were able to predict the near future quite close to the reality but most of them went astray. In this study, we review major forecasting models that were used in the context of India during country-wise lockdown and compare them. From these comparisons, we can see that while the advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic, effects can be catastrophic if poorly fitting models are used for predictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhinav Gola","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Arya","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Animesh Animesh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dugh","author_inst":"The University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Gaughan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Louisa Blackwell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Nicky Rogers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Myer Glickman","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA; Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.01.20166470","rel_title":"Characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in East Kalimantan, Indonesia","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.01.20166470","rel_abs":"Introduction. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On March 2, 2020, Indonesia announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. East Kalimantan will play an important role as the new capital of Indonesia. There is attention to the preparedness of East Kalimantan to respond to COVID-19. We report the characteristics of COVID-19 fatality cases in here. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients from the East Kalimantan Health Office information system. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR examination. Results. By July 31, 2020, 31 fatality cases of patients had been identified as having confirmed COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 + 9.2 years. Most of the patients were men (22 [71.0%]) with age more than 60 years old (14 [45.2%]). Balikpapan has the highest number of COVID-19 fatality cases from all regencies. Hypertension was the most comorbidities in the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan. Discussion. Older age and comorbidities still contributed to the fatality cases of COVID-19 patients in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were underlying conditions for increasing the risk of COVID-19 getting into a serious condition. Conclusion. Active surveillance for people older than 60 years old and having underlying diseases is needed for reducing the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in East Kalimantan. Keywords. Comorbidity, fatality cases, COVID-19, Indonesia.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swandari Paramita","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Ronny Isnuwardana","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Krispinus Duma","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Rahmat Bakhtiar","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Khairul Nuryanto","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Riries Choiru Pramulia Yudia","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Evi Fitriany","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Meiliati Aminyoto","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Myer Glickman","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Public health scotland"},{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA; Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Department of Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.20167395","rel_title":"Viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.20167395","rel_abs":"Background - There currently is substantial controversy about the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols in disease transmission, due in part to detections of viral RNA but failures to isolate viable virus from clinically generated aerosols. Methods - Air samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly admitted patient in the room were sequenced. Findings - Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units\/L of air. Interpretation - Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John A Lednicky","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Michael Lauzardo","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Z.

The case mortality rate among hospitalized patients aged 60-69 years fell significantly from the first to the third interval. During the fourth interval, an apparent rise in mortality among hospitalized patients in the same age group was mirrored by a significant decline in mortality among those not hospitalized.

In spite of the presumed time advantage for the implementation of preventive measures to help contain its spread, the pandemic in that region followed growth rates that paralleled, and currently exceed, those observed several weeks before in Europe. Indeed, in early August, 2020, many countries in South and Central America presented among the highest rates in the world of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths per million inhabitants. Here, we have taken an ecological approach to describe the current state of the pandemic in Peru and its dynamics. Our analysis supports a protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Further, we provide circumstantial evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. Finally, we show that protection by altitude is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence in the population of risk factors associated with severe COVID-19, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We discuss long-term multisystemic adaptations to hypobaric hypoxia as possible mechanisms that may explain the observed protective effect of high altitude from death from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy M Thomson","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Biology, IBMB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Fresia Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Harold Andre Guerrero","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"R\u00f3mulo Figueroa-Mujica","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Francisco C Villafuerte","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Machicado","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Moiz Usmani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sripriya N Shankar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Karim Mohamed","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Arantza Eiguren-Fernandez","author_inst":"Aerosol Dynamics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Caroline J Stephenson","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Md.

Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: Responses were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic between April 27th and July 13th. Participants: 398 LGBTQ+ respondents forming an analytical sample of 310 in the main models. Methods: We used a combined measure of gender identity or expression and sexual orientation as the main explanatory variable. We assessed mental health with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D-10). We measured experiences of discrimination with a battery of questions that asked respondents whether they had experienced a set of discriminatory experiences because of their LGBTQ+ identity during the coronavirus pandemic. Experiences of discrimination was considered a mediating factor and examined both as an outcome as well as an explanatory variable. Models were adjusted for a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: The prevalence of depression and stress were both high, with the majority of the sample exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (69%). Around one-in-six respondents reported some form of discrimination since the start of the pandemic because they were LGBTQ+ (16.7%). In regression models, the average score for perceived stress increased by 1.44 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.517-2.354) for those who had experienced an instance of homophobic or transphobic harassment, compared to respondents who had not. Similarly, the odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptomology (CES-D-10 scores of 10 or more) increased three-fold among those who had experienced harassment based on their gender or sexuality compared to those who had not (OR: 3.251; 95% CI: 1.168-9.052). These marked associations remained after adjustment for a number of socioeconomic and demographic covariates. Cis-female respondents who identify as gay or lesbian had the lowest scores for perceived social or depressive symptoms; conversely transgender and gender diverse individuals had the highest scores. Conclusions: We found high levels of stress and depressive symptoms, particularly among younger and transgender and gender diverse respondents. These associations were partially explained by experiences of discrimination which had a large, consistent and pernicious impact on stress and mental health.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dylan Kneale","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laia Becares","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Harold Andre Guerrero","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"R\u00f3mulo Figueroa-Mujica","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Francisco C Villafuerte","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Claudia Machicado","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Moiz Usmani","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Sripriya N Shankar","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Karim Mohamed","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Arantza Eiguren-Fernandez","author_inst":"Aerosol Dynamics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Caroline J Stephenson","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Md.

Increasing frequency of 614G may therefore be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of Spike 614G at the level of an individual country, the United Kingdom, using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected by COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Using phylogenetic analysis, we identify Spike 614G and 614D clades with unique origins in the UK and from these we extrapolate and compare growth rates of co-circulating transmission clusters. We find that Spike 614G clusters are introduced in the UK later on average than 614D clusters and grow to larger size after adjusting for time of introduction. Phylodynamic analysis does not show a significant increase in growth rates for clusters with the 614G variant, but population genetic modelling indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We also investigate the potential influence of Spike 614D versus G on virulence by matching a subset of records to clinical data on patient outcomes. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the Spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality, but younger patients have slightly increased odds of 614G carriage. Despite the availability of a very large data set, well represented by both Spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of higher transmission rate for 614G, but significant differences in growth, size, and composition of these lineages indicate a need for continued study.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Verity Hill","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"John T McCrone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Price","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

Without social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 will grow exponentially, but social distancing and people's learning behavior (isolating, staying at home, wearing face masks, washing hands, restricting the size and frequency of group gatherings, etc.) can significantly impede the epidemic spread, flatten the infection curve, and change the final outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results demonstrate that strict social distancing and people's learning behavior can be effective in slowing the spread rate and significantly reducing the total number of infections, daily infection rate, peak of daily infections, and duration of the epidemic. Under strict social distancing, the rise and fall of infections would be nearly symmetric about the peak of of daily infections, and the epidemic spread would be essentially over within 60 days. Relaxing social distancing and people learning behaviors will significantly increase the total and daily numbers of infections and prolong the course of the outbreak. These results have immediate applications for the implementation of various social-distancing policies and general significance for ongoing outbreaks and similar infectious disease epidemics in the future.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baolian Cheng","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ming Wang","author_inst":"Retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"John T McCrone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Anna Price","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

This analysis aimed to assess how mothers are feeling and coping during lockdown, and to identify the potential pathways that can assist them. Methods: 1329 women living in the UK aged [&ge;]18 years with an infant [&le;]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey. Descriptive analysis of maternal mental health, coping, support received, activities undertaken and consequences of lockdown was conducted. Linear regression was used to predict maternal mental health and coping, using activities, support, and consequences of the lockdown as predictors, while adjusting for age, gestational age, ethnicity, income, marital status and number of children. Results: More than half of the participants reported feeling down (56%), lonely (59%), irritable (62%) and worried (71%), to some or high extent since lockdown began. Despite this, 70% felt able to cope with the situation. Support with her own health (95% CI .004, .235), contacting infant support groups (95% CI -.003, .252), and higher infant gestational age (95% CI .000, .063) predicted better mental health. Travelling for work (95% CI -.680, -.121), lockdown having a major impact on the ability to afford food (95% CI -1.202, -.177), and having an income lower than 30k (95% CI -.475, -.042) predicted poorer mental health. Support with her own health and more equal division of household chores were associated with better coping. Conclusion: During lockdown, a large proportion of new mothers experienced symptoms of poor mental health; mothers of infants with lower gestational age, with low income, and who are travelling to work were particularly at risk. However, greater support for maternal health and with household chores showed positive associations with maternal mental health and coping. These findings highlight the urgent need to assess maternal mental health, and to identify prevention strategies for mothers during different stages of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Dib","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Emeline Rougeaux","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Adriana V\u00e1zquez-V\u00e1zquez","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Jonathan CK Wells","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Mary Fewtrell","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Aine O'Toole","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joel Alexander Southgate","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Jackson","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F.

Developing tools to measure seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent important tools in less-resourced settings. Methods: We established an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South African patients (n=77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were taken a median of six weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma (n=58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva. Results: We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1-specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and OD values were strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma, 1\/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses. Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3200. S1-specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohau S Makatsa","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marius B Tincho","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jerome M Wendoh","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Sherazaan D Ismail","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Rofhiwa Nesamari","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pera","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Scott de Beer","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and Google for Covid-19 for viral culture or viral replication and associated synonyms up to 31st August 2020. We carried out citation matching and included studies reporting attempts to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 matching the with cutoffs for RT-PCR positivity. One reviewer extracted data for each study and a second reviewer checked end edited the extraction and summarised the narratively by sample: fecal, respiratory, environment or mixed. Where necessary we wrote to corresponding authors of the included or background papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19. Summaries of the included studies and the protocol (v1) are available at: https:\/\/www.cebm.net\/evidence-synthesis\/transmission-dynamics-of-covid-19\/. Searches are updated every 2 weeks. This is the third version of this review that was fist published on the 4th of August and updated on the 21St of August. https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.08.04.20167932v2 Results We included 25 studies reporting culturing or observing tissue invasion by SARS-CoV in sputum, naso or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental samples from patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The data are suggestive of a relation between the time from collection of a specimen to test, cycle threshold (as a proxy for viral load) and symptom severity. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. Ten studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in those with live virus culture. Nine studies reported no growth in samples based on a Ct cut-off value. These values ranged from CT > 24 for no growth to Ct greater or equal to 34. Two studies report a strong relationship between Ct value and ability to recover infectious virus and that the odds of live virus culture reduced by 33% for every one unit increase in Ct. A cut-off RT-PCR Ct > 30 was associated with non-infectious samples. One study that analysed the NSP, N and E gene fragments of the PCR result reported different cut-off thresholds depending on the gene fragment analysed. The duration of RNA shedding detected by PCR was far longer compared to detection of live culture. Six out of eight studies reported RNA shedding for longer than 14 days. Yet, Infectivity declines after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. A very small proportion of people re-testing positive after hospital discharge or with high Ct are likely to be infectious. Conclusion Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patients factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. A binary Yes\/No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Spencer","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jon Brassey","author_inst":"Trip Database Ltd"},{"author_name":"Carl Heneghan","author_inst":"Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Rofhiwa Nesamari","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Francisco Pera","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Scott de Beer","author_inst":"Cape Bio Pharms"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Researches are ongoing to find an efficient treatment strategy for this disease by either inactivating the virus or boosting the immune system of patient or by managing the cytokine storm. Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of Substance P receptor Neurokinin 1 antagonist in Covid 19 patients against the usual treatments as controls. Patients and Methods: It is a randomized clinical trial, open label, having two arms, one receiving normal management and care while other receiving Neurokinin 1 Receptor antagonist, Aprepitant, in addition. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid is also administered orally to both the groups. PCR positive, hospitalized patients with more than 18 years of age, both genders, moderate to critical phase were included. 18 patients were randomly allocated in both arms, having 10 in group A and 8 in group B. Lab investigations were performed in both the groups before and after the intervention. We report preliminary results for the comparison of Aprepitant 80 mg given once daily for 3 to 5 days vs routine management. The primary outcome was total in hospital days and duration of disease. Results: Mean age of patients in group A was 47.63 +12.07years while 60.90+ 9.75 years in group B. There were 3 males in group A and 8 in group B. There were 2 critical patients in group A and 5 in group B. Biochemical and hematological parameters in both groups didnot show much difference except the C reactive protein reduction in the intervention group, indicative of a reduced inflammation. Oxygen saturation also improved but more patients should be enrolled to get a statistically significant data. One patient was discharged from each group within 5 days and one patient expired in each. Conclusions: It is a pilot study but the findings give a strong clue for the therapeutic potential of Aprepitant. Patients who received a combination therapy of Aprepitant and Dexamethasone were recovered earlier and showed improved clinical outcomes, laboratory findings and reduced C reactive protein which is an inflammatory marker. We suggest here a study on larger sample size to get a deeper insight of its potential and efficacy. It may be more effective in severe to critical patients having respiratory difficulties.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Riffat Mehboob","author_inst":"University of Lahore"},{"author_name":"Fridoon Ahmad","author_inst":"University of health sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ahad Qayyum","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asim Rana","author_inst":"Bahria International Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Amir Gilani","author_inst":"University of Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Akram Tariq","author_inst":"Higher education department, Punjab, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Javed Akram","author_inst":"University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Anura David","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Sarika Jugwanth","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, and remains uncertainty over key aspects of its infectivity, no effective remedy yet exists and this disease causes severe economic effects globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially impact on public opinions in some cases and exacerbate widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topics extracting model (named TClustVID) that analyze COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed to Twitter datasets which enabled exploration of the performance of traditional and TClustVID classification methods. TClustVID showed higher performance compared to the traditional classifiers determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topic clusters from TClustVID, split them into positive, neutral and negative clusters and implemented latent dirichlet allocation for extraction of popular COVID-19 topics. This approach identified common prevailing public opinions and concerns related to COVID-19, as well as attitudes to infection prevention strategies held by people from different countries concerning the current pandemic situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We sought to determine the change in rates and types of admissions to tertiary and specialty care hospitals in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-COVID-19 era. Methods Acute care admissions to the largest tertiary care referral hospital, designated national referral centers for cardiac, cancer and maternity hospital in the State of Qatar during March 2020 (COVID-19 era) and January 2020 and March 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) were compared. We calculated total admissions, and admissions for eight specific acute care conditions, in-hospital mortality rate and length of stay at each hospital. Results A total of 18,889 hospital admissions were recorded. A sharp decline ranging from 9%-75% was observed in overall admissions. A decline in both elective and non-elective surgeries was observed. A decline of 9%-58% was observed in admissions for acute appendicitis, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, bone fractures, cancer and live births, while an increase in admissions due to respiratory tract infections was observed. Overall length of stay was shorter in the COVID-19 period possibly suggesting lesser overall disease severity, with no significant change in in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted mortality rate for Qatar showed marginal increase in the COVID-19 period. Conclusions We observed a sharp decline in acute care hospital admissions, with a significant decline in admissions due to seven out of eight acute care conditions. This decline was associated with a shorter length of stay, but not associated with a change in in-hospital mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anand B Kartha","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Naseer A Masoodi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Aftab M Azad","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Nidal A Asaad","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mohamad U Alhomsi","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huda A Saleh","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Badi Abou-Samra","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Maemu P Gededzha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Nakampe Mampeule","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Ian Sanne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Wendy Stevens","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, $R$, has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control ($R<1$). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks. Here, we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Malcolm G Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"- ISARIC4C Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Michael J Tildesley","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward M Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Claude Houdayer","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Rouen University Hospital and Inserm U1245, UNIROUEN, Normandie Univ, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, France"},{"author_name":"Manuel Etienne","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Caron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Plantier","author_inst":"Virology Laboratory, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France"},{"author_name":"Thierry Frebourg","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Rouen University Hospital and Inserm U1245, UNIROUEN, Normandie Univ, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, France"},{"author_name":"Lesley Scott","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Blackburn","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth S Mayne","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Roanne S Keeton","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Burgers","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Kathy Li","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Ruth Jarrett","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Nicole Pacchiarini","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Bull","author_inst":"Public Health Wales NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

To resolve these issues, we developed SalivaDirect. The critical component of our approach is to use saliva instead of respiratory swabs, which enables non-invasive frequent sampling and reduces the need for trained healthcare professionals during collection. Furthermore, we simplified our diagnostic test by (1) not requiring nucleic acid preservatives at sample collection, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple proteinase K and heat treatment step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. We validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize the risk for supply chain issues. Regardless of our tested combination of reagents and instruments from different vendors, we found that SalivaDirect is highly sensitive with a limit of detection of 6-12 SARS-CoV-2 copies\/L. When comparing paired nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva specimens using the authorized ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit and our SalivaDirect protocol, we found high agreement in testing outcomes (>94%). Being flexible and inexpensive ($1.29-$4.37\/sample), SalivaDirect is a viable and accessible option to help alleviate SARS-CoV-2 testing demands.

Comorbidities have been reported to be risk factors for the complications of COVID-19. In this work, we develop and analyze a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in order to assess the impacts of prior comorbidity on COVID-19 complications and COVID-19 re-infection. The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of re-infection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis of the model when the population of individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and comorbidity is used as response function revealed that the top ranked parameters that drive the dynamics of the co-infection model are the effective contact rate for COVID-19 transmission, {beta}cv, the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 by comorbid susceptibles, {chi}cm, the comorbidity development rate, {theta}cm, the detection rate for singly infected and co-infected individuals, {eta}1 and {eta}2, as well as the recovery rate from COVID-19 for co-infected individuals, {phi}i2. Simulations of the model reveal that the cumulative confirmed cases (without comorbidity) may get up to 180,000 after 200 days, if the hyper susceptibility rate of comorbid susceptibles is as high as 1.2 per day. Also, the cumulative confirmed cases (including those co-infected with comorbidity) may be as high as 1000,000 cases by the end of November, 2020 if the re-infection rates for COVID-19 is 0.1 per day. It may be worse than this if the re-infection rates increase higher. Moreover, if policies are strictly put in place to step down the probability of COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles to as low as 0.4 per day and step up the detection rate for singly infected individuals to 0.7 per day, then the reproduction number can be brought very low below one, and COVID-19 infection eliminated from the population. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles has the least ICER and is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Omame","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ndolane Sene","author_inst":"University Cheikh Anta Diop"},{"author_name":"Ikenna Nometa","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Manoa"},{"author_name":"Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma","author_inst":"Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi, Korea"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Ugochukwu Nwafor","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Nneka Onyinyechi Iheonu","author_inst":"Federal University of Technology Owerri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Daniel Okuonghae","author_inst":"University of Benin, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Moore","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Yale University"},{"author_name":"M.

Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4- to 5-month-old cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel contact cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding throughout the 21 DPC observation period. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling. The results of this study are critical for our understanding of the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment of the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 in felines and transmission to other animals and humans.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natasha N Gaudreault","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Jessie D Trujillo","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Mariano Carossino","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"David A Meekins","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Igor Morozov","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Daniel W Madden","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Sabarish V Indran","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Dashzeveg Bold","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Velmurugan Balaraman","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Taeyong Kwon","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Bianca Libanori Artiaga","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Konner Cool","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"William C Wilson","author_inst":"Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture"},{"author_name":"Jamie Henningson","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Udeni BR Balasuriya","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Juergen A Richt","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pei Hui","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chen Liu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David L Robertson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Emma C Thomson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas R Connor","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"- The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
