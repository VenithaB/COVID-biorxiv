In addition to infectious and respiratory disease physicians, many doctors in other medical fields have been infected. Methods We prospectively collected epidemiological data on medical staff members who are working in neurosurgery departments in 107 hospitals in Hubei province through self-reported questionnaires or telephone interviews. Data of medical staff members with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were analysed. The final follow-up date was 1 March 2020. Findings A total of 5,442 neurosurgery department medical staff members were surveyed. One hundred and twenty cases, involving 54 doctors and 66 nurses, were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The overall incidence was 2.2%. These cases were concentrated in 26 centres, 16 of which had admitted a total of 59 patients with COVID-19 complicated by craniocerebral disease. Medical staff members in centres receiving COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of contracting infection than those in centres not receiving COVID-19 patients (relative risk: 19.6; 95% confidence interval: 12.6-30.6). Contact with either COVID-19 patients (62.5%, 75\/120) or infected colleagues (30.8%, 37\/120) was the most common mode of transmission. About 78.3% (94\/120) of the infected cases wore surgical masks, whereas 20.8% (25\/120) failed to use protection when exposed to the source of infection. Severe infections were observed in 11.7% (14\/120) of the cases, with one death (0.8%, 1\/120). All the infected medical staff members had been discharged from the hospital. A total of 1,287 medical staff members were dispatched to participate in the frontline response to COVID-19 under level 2 protection of whom one was infected. Medical staff members who took inadequate protection had a higher risk of contracting infection than those using level 2 protection (relative risk: 36.9; 95% confidence interval: 5.2-263.6). Interpretation Neurosurgical staff members in Hubei province were seriously affected by COVID-19. Level 2 protection and strengthening of protective measures are likely to be effective in preventing medical workers from being infected.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiangping Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022"},{"author_name":"Xing Huang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Yansen Bai","author_inst":"Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 13 Hangkong"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Haijun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Xuebin Hu","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Xianke Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Jincao Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, 430071."},{"author_name":"Qianxue Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, 430060."},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.059667","rel_title":"Critical role of type III interferon in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and spread in primary human intestinal epithelial cells","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.059667","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented worldwide health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to better understand the virus in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and to better prepare against potential future emergence of novel pandemic viruses. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets cells of the lung epithelium causing respiratory infection and pathologies, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. However, the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for virus-induced pathologies, spreading and prognosis remains unknown. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles. Importantly, we identified intestinal epithelial cells as the best culture model to propagate SARS-CoV-2. We found that viral infection elicited an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where, interestingly, type III interferon mediated response was significantly more efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread compared to type I interferon. Taken together, our data demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing in increasing patient viremia and by fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Megan Lynn Stanifer","author_inst":"Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany"},{"author_name":"Carmon Kee","author_inst":"DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,  Heidelberg University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sergio triana","author_inst":"EMBL, Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Markus Mukenhirn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,  Heidelberg University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Kraeusslich","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,  Heidelberg University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Theodore Alexandrov","author_inst":"EMBL"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,  Heidelberg University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steeve Boulant","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Qianxue Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, 430060."},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20062174","rel_title":"Higher mortality in men from COVID19 infection-understanding the factors that drive the differences between the biological sexes.","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20062174","rel_abs":"The emergent global pandemic caused by the rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to increased mortality and negatively impacted day to day activities of humankind within a short period of time. As the data is rapidly emerging from earlier outbreak locations around the world, there are efforts to assimilate this with the knowledge from prior epidemics and find rapid solutions for this. One of the observations and a recurring theme is the disproportionate differences in the incidence of infection and the consequent mortality between males and females. We, therefore, analyzed retrospective datasets from the previous epidemics and the ongoing pandemic in order to address these differences in clinical outcomes. The data shows that even though the infection rates are similar, the odds ratio of male mortality remains high, indicating a divergence in the crosstalk between the three pathogenic human Coronavirus (hCoVs)- the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 and immune effectors in the two sexes. One proximate cause is the sex-specific modulation of the X-linked genes that can influence susceptibility to infection. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which can form the basis for developing rational strategies for ending the current and preventing future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swaminathan P Iyer","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Joe Ensor","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kartik Anand","author_inst":"Great Plains Health"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hwu","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Vivek Subbiah","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher Flowers","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Rudragouda Channappanavar","author_inst":"University of Tennessee Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,  Heidelberg University, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steeve Boulant","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Qianxue Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, 430060."},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Jiang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, 430022."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.055863","rel_title":"Genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 mutations","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.055863","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant public health issue in recent history. Its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has evolved rapidly since its first emergence in December 2019. Mutations in the viral genome have critical impacts on the adaptation of viral strains to the local environment, and may alter the characteristics of viral transmission, disease manifestation, and the efficacy of treatment and vaccination. Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic.\n\nSignificance StatementMutation is the driving force of evolution for viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19. In this study, we discovered that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly from the originally isolated form. These mutations have been spreading around the world and caused more than 2.5 million of infected cases and 170 thousands of deaths. We found that fourteen frequent mutations identified in this study can characterize the six main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In addition, we found the mutation burden is positively correlated with the fatality of COVID-19 patients. Understanding mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome will provide useful insight for the design of treatment and vaccination.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsin-Chou Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Chun-houh Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Jen-Hung Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Hsiao-Ch Liao","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Chih-Ting Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Chia-Wei Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Yin-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"Chiun-How Kao","author_inst":"Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica"},{"author_name":"James C.

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells, notably type II alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, ACE2 gene is highly polymorphic. Here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. We found that S19P (common in African people) and K26R (common in European people) were, among the most diffused SNPs worldwide, the only two SNPs that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 spike. FireDock simulations demonstrated that while S19P may decrease, K26R might increase the ACE2 affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike. This finding suggests that the S19P may genetically protect, and K26R may predispose to more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Calcagnile","author_inst":"Salento University, Italy"},{"author_name":"Patricia Forgez","author_inst":"INSERM, France"},{"author_name":"Antonio Iannelli","author_inst":"CHU Nice, France"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Bucci","author_inst":"Salento University, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Alifano","author_inst":"Cochin Hospital APHP University of Paris"},{"author_name":"Pietro Alifano","author_inst":"Salento University, Italy"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Hutchinson","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Maria Morales-Betoulle","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Inna Krapinunaya","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ardith Gibbons","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Chiang","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cannon","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"John Klena","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and on S-protein priming by host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. Recently, COVID19 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) yet high differences in disease outcomes across countries have been seen. We provide evidences to explain these population-level differences. One of the key factors of entry of the virus in host cells presumably is because of differential interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins due to different genetic backgrounds. Based on our findings, we conclude that a higher expression of ACE2 is facilitated by natural variations, acting as Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), with different frequencies in different populations. We suggest that high expression of ACE2 results in homo-dimerization, proving disadvantageous for TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2; whereas, the monomeric ACE2 has higher preferential binding with SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein vis-a-vis its dimerized counterpart. Further, eQTLs in TMPRSS2 and natural structural variations in the gene may also result in differential outcomes towards priming of viral S-protein, a critical step for entry of the Virus in host cells. In addition, we suggest that several key host genes, like SLC6A19, ADAM17, RPS6, HNRNPA1, SUMO1, NACA, BTF3 and some other proteases as Cathepsins, might have a critical role. To conclude, understanding population specific differences in these genes may help in developing appropriate management strategies for COVID19 with better therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swarkar Sharma","author_inst":"Human Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India"},{"author_name":"Inderpal Singh","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Bioinfores Pvt.

We report the production of specific IgM and IgG antibodies after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its implication for the diagnosis, pathology and the course of the disease as well as the recurrence of positive nucleic acid tests after discharge. Methods: Test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of 221 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively examined, and their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on various subgroups. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined with the chemiluminescence method. Findings: The concentration (S\/CO) of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, with a median of 17.38 (IQR 4.39-36.4) for IgM and 5.59 (IQR 0.73-13.65) for IgG. Detection rates reached highest on day 16-18 and day 19-21 for IgM and IgG, which were 73.6% and 98.6%, respectively, with significantly higher concentration of IgG in critically ill patients than in those with mild to moderate disease (P=0.027). The concentration of the antibodies on day 16-21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease (Spearman r < 0.20, P > 0.05). Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in up to 52.7% of recovered patients after discharge, whose IgG proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative RNA results (P = 0.009). IgG and IgM were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7-day interval, and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21.2% (IQR, 11.2%34.48%) for IgG and 23.05% (IQR, -27.96%46.13%) for IgM, without statistical significance between the patients with re-detectable positive RNA results and those with negative RNA results after discharge. However, those with positive results experienced a count decrease in lymphocyte subsets. Interpretation: The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, and antibody testing on day 16-21 is associated with increased detection rates, but the antibody concentration does not affect the course and outcome of the infection. Recovering patients with re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA displayed lower concentration of IgG, but the downward trend of IgG during recovery indicated its limited duration of protection, and the protective effect of IgG remains to be investigated.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qianfang Hu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Cui","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinzhu Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bin Peng","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics, School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinyue Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Department of Health Management Centre, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Hu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi Ao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Duan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xue Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Linxiao Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuliang Guo","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Guicheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Hepatopathy, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sherry Michelle Owen","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Barney S.

A thorough literature search was conducted to source information on the pharmacological properties of 5 drugs and 1 combination (azithromycin, chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir\/ritonavir) repurposed to treat COVID-19. A risk assessment of drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs was performed and compared to 23 well-known torsadogenic and 10 low torsadogenic risk compounds. Computer calculations were performed using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including affinity to block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (IKr) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG), propensity to prolong cardiac repolarization (QT interval) and cause torsade de pointes (TdP). Seven different LQTS indices were calculated and compared. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried with specific key words relating to arrhythmogenic events. Estimators of LQTS risk levels indicated a very high or moderate risk for all COVID-19 repurposed drugs with the exception for azithromycin, although cases of TdP have been reported with this drug. There was excellent agreement among the various indices used to assess risk of drug-induced LQTS for the 6 repurposed medications and 23 torsadogenic compounds. Based on our results, monitoring of the QT interval shall be performed when some COVID-19 repurposed drugs are used, as such monitoring is possible for hospitalized patients or with the use of biodevices for outpatients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronique Michaud","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dow","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Sweilem B Al Rihani","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Malavika Deodhar","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Meghan Arwood","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Brian Cicali","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Jacques Turgeon","author_inst":"Tabula Rasa HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Hu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi Ao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Duan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xue Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Linxiao Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuliang Guo","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Guicheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Hepatopathy, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sherry Michelle Owen","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Barney S.

We further evidence that, in cities under more critical situations, people are likely to engage COVID-19-related searches more frequently, while they are not likely to escape from the cities. Finally, the correlation analysis using search and mobility data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to travel less, even while the overall travel demands are low compared to the historical records.

The goal of this ecological cross-sectional study is to examine the demographic and economic nature of spatial hot and cold spots of SARS-CoV-2 rates in New York City and Chicago as of April 13, 2020. In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) demonstrated typical protective factors associated with the social determinants of health and the ability to social distance. These neighborhoods tended to be wealthier, have higher educational attainment, higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents, and more workers in managerial occupations. Hot spots (clusters of high SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) also had similarities, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color. It also appears to be larger households (more people per household), rather than overall population density, that may to be a more strongly associated with hot spots. Findings suggest important differences between the cities' hot spots as well. They can be generalized by describing the NYC hot spots as working-class and middle-income communities, perhaps indicative of service workers and other occupations (including those classified as \"essential services\" during the pandemic) that may not require a college degree but pay wages above poverty levels. Chicago's hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city's most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew R Maroko","author_inst":"CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy"},{"author_name":"Denis Nash","author_inst":"CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy"},{"author_name":"Brian Pavilonis","author_inst":"CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy"},{"author_name":"Siyu Huang","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Haozhe An","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Qi Kang","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Ying Li","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Dejing Dou","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Haifeng Wang","author_inst":"Baidu Inc."},{"author_name":"Jun Duan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xue Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Linxiao Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuliang Guo","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Guicheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Hepatopathy, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sherry Michelle Owen","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Barney S.

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival. Methods: We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. Findings: Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of six months would cause attributable death of 10,555 of these individuals with loss of 205,024 life years. For cancer surgery, average life years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 15.9 with a delay of six months (a loss of 2.3 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 1.98 RALYGs following delay of six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 474,505 LYGs requiring of 1,097,937 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.0 LYG and 0.43 RALYGs. Interpretation: Delay of six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 43% of life years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community acquired COVID-19. This rises to 62% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihoodratio (LR) + 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score [&ge;]3; n=17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score [&ge;]2; n=137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick first screening tool.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hester A Gietema","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Grow school for oncology and developmental biology, Maastricht University, Maastricht"},{"author_name":"Noortje Zelis","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Section Acute Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Centre, CARIM School for Cardiovas"},{"author_name":"J.

We aimed to study the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort of 115 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory indicators and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Known adverse prognostic factors were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effects on outcomes. Results Among 115 patients, 73 patients (63.5%) received corticosteroid. The levels of age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and albumin were similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013). In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of either mortality or ICU admission, although not statistically significant. Conclusion No evidence suggests that adult patients with COVID-19 will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Wang","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Juan Yang","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Gao","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Jiang","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Lintong Ge","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Liu","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hubei Province, Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Phillip Ward","author_inst":"Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Healthcare workers around the world utilize N95 masks to protect themselves and their patients, yet during this global pandemic they are forced to re-wear what is intended to be single-use masks. This poses significant risk to these healthcare workers along with the populations they are trying to protect. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been validated previously as a way to effectively sterilize these masks between use, however, not all facilities have access to the high cost commercial UV-C lamp sterilization equipment. However, UV-C bulbs are sitting idle in biosafety cabinets (BSCs) at universities and research facilities around the globe that have been shuttered to slow the spread of COVID-19. These bulbs may also be available in existing medical centers where infectious diseases are commonly treated. Therefore, we have developed a method to modify existing light fixtures, or create custom light fixtures compatible with new or existing common UV-C bulbs. This system is scalable and can be created for less than 50 US dollars, on site, at the point of need, and leverages resources that are currently untapped and sitting unused in public and private research facilities. The freely-accessible design can be easily modified for use around the world. Hospitals can obtain this potentially life-saving UVGI resource with minimal funds, via collaboration between research facilities to obtain the UV-C meters and limited availability UVGI bulbs. While mask reuse is not ideal, we must do what we can in emergency situations to protect our frontline healthcare workers and the communities they serve.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel M Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Michael J Donzanti","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Minahan","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Shirazi","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Christine L Hatem","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Brielle Hayward-Piatkovskyi","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Allyson M Dang","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Katherine M Nelson","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Kimberly L Bothi","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Jason P Gleghorn","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

The clinical symptoms of severe and non-severe patients vary, and the case-fatality rate (CFR) in severe COVID-19 patients is very high. However, the information on the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 and of their prognostic potential is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome data were collected and analyzed from 223 COVID-19 patients stratified into 125 non-severe patients and 98 severe patients. In addition, a pooled large-scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases was performed. RESULTS: We found that the age, gender and comorbidities are the common risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. For the diagnosis markers, we found that the levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in severe group compared with the non-severe group on admission (D-Dimer: 87.3% vs. 35.3%, P<0.001; CRP, 65.1% vs. 13.5%, P<0.001; LDH: 83.9% vs. 22.2%, P<0.001; PCT: 35.1% vs. 2.2%, P<0.001), while the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) and creatinine kinase (CK) were only mildly increased. We also made a large scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases combined with 4 related literatures, and further confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 severity and these risk factors. Moreover, we tracked dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19, and found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in high levels in severe patient. Among all these markers, D-dimer increased remarkably in severe patients and mostly related with the case-fatality rate (CFR). We found adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis markers CRP, D-dimer, LDH and PCT are associated with severity of COVID-19. Among these markers, D-dimer is sensitive for both severity and CFR of COVID-19. Treatment with heparin or other anticoagulants may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongshent Huang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Lyu","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, the Central Hospital of Wuhan , Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center\/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer\/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Scie"},{"author_name":"Yujun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Critical care medicine, the Central Hospital of Wuhan , Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Zou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yingxin Wei","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Christopher Hammond","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Scott","author_inst":"RM Partners, West London Cancer Alliance, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul D.P.

Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM\/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM\/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY\/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis A Perez-Jurado","author_inst":"Genetics Unit, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Hospital del Mar Research Institute (IMIM)"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Caceres","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Tonu Esko","author_inst":"EGCUT"},{"author_name":"Juan R Gonzalez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medicine Peking Union Medical College, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Zou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yingxin Wei","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Ltd"},{"author_name":"Christopher Hammond","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Scott","author_inst":"RM Partners, West London Cancer Alliance, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul D.P.

Methods: A total of 32 children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 24 and February 12, 2020 from four provinces in Western China were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and quarantine 14 days later. Results: Eleven children (34%) were asymptomatic, among whom six children had normal computed tomographic (CT) scan images. Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD=7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test. Conclusions: Children with asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for the same duration as symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical significance and mechanism behind the negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 needs further study.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongmei Xu","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical university"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Xie","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Smyth","author_inst":"The Institute of Child Health at University College London"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Ruiqiu Zhao","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Na Zang","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoru Long","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyi Tang","author_inst":"The National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Children`s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Janne Estill","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland;

This is compounded by the shortage of available tests causing numerous healthcare workers to unnecessarily self-isolate. We provide a roadmap instructing how a research institute can be repurposed in the midst of this crisis, in collaboration with partner hospitals and an established diagnostic laboratory, harnessing existing expertise in virus handling, robotics, PCR, and data science to derive a rapid, high throughput diagnostic testing pipeline for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with suspected COVID-19. The pipeline is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from combined nose-throat swabs and endotracheal secretions\/ bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, it relies on a series of in-house buffers for virus inactivation and the extraction of viral RNA, thereby reducing the dependency on commercial suppliers at times of global shortage. We use a commercial RT-PCR assay, from BGI, and results are reported with a bespoke online web application that integrates with the healthcare digital system. This strategy facilitates the remote reporting of thousands of samples a day with a turnaround time of under 24 hours, universally applicable to laboratories worldwide.","rel_num_authors":80,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jim Aitken","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Karen Ambrose","author_inst":"The Francis Crick

distancing exhibits universal dynamics. The cumulative numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the erf function. Using this functional form, we perform a data collapse across countries and US states with very different population characteristics and social distancing policies, confirming the universal behavior of the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that the predictive power of statistical models is limited until a few days before curves flatten, forecast deaths and infections assuming current policies continue and compare our predictions to the IHME models. We present simulations showing this universal dynamics is consistent with disease transmission on scale-free networks and random networks with non-Markovian transmission dynamics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Marsland III","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Mehta","author_inst":"Boston

2019 (COVID-19), is associated with respiratory-related morbidity and mortality. Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. Methodology: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies by luciferase immunoprecipitation assay systems (LIPS) to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. A subset of samples was tested with and without heat inactivation. Results: Fifteen or more days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from six patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike antibodies appearing between day 8 to day 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to immunocompetent patients. Conclusions: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples by LIPS is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter D

obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease or hypertension have a high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM2.5, has also been associated with COVID-19 mortality. We collated individual-level data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average levels of air pollutants as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the time of emergency response. Other variables included census, smoking prevalence, climate, and socio-economic data from 324 cities in China. We adjusted for human mobility and socio-economic factors, and found that an increase in long-term NO2 or PM2.5 may correspond to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and severe infections. However, the linkage might also be affected by the confounding factor of population size because of the predefined correlation between population size and air pollution. The results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings of this paper (and other previous studies that have given ambiguous results) indicate that a more definitive analysis is needed of the link between COVID-19 and air pollution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pai Zheng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Song","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA"},{"author_name":"Chieh-Hsi Wu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bingying Li","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Moritz  U.

Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic with several thousands of confirmed cases of infection and death. However, the death rate across affected countries shows variation deserving of critical evaluation. Methods: In this study, we evaluated differentials in COVID-19 confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths of selected countries in Sub-Sahara Africa (Nigeria and Ghana), South Africa, Europe (Italy, Spain, Sweden and UK) and USA. Data acquired for various standard databases on mutational shift of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on geographical location, BCG vaccination policy, malaria endemicity, climatic conditions (temperature), differential healthcare approaches were evaluated over a period of 45 days from the date of reporting the index case. Results: The number of confirmed cases of infection and associated deaths in Sub-Sahara Africa were found to be very low compared to the very high values in Europe and USA over the same period. Recovery rate from COVID-19 is not correlated with the mutational attributes of the virus with the sequenced strain from Nigeria having no significant difference (p>0.05) from other geographical regions. Significantly higher (p<0.05) infection rate and mortality from COVID-19 were observed in countries (Europe and USA) without a current universal BCG vaccination policy compared to those with one (Sub-Sahara African countries). Countries with high malaria burden had significantly lower (p<0.05) cases of COVID-19 than those with low malaria burden. A strong negative correlation (-0.595) between mean annual temperature and COVID-19 infection and death was observed with 14.8% variances between temperature and COVID-19 occurrence among the countries. A clear distinction was observed in the COVID-19 disease management between the developed countries (Europe and USA) and Sub-Sahara Africa. Conclusions: The study established that the wide variation in the outcome of the COVID-19 disease burden in the selected countries are attributable largely to climatic condition (temperature) and differential healthcare approaches to management of the disease. We recommend consideration and mainstreaming of these findings for urgent intervention and management of COVID-19 across these continents.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adebayo

study","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.20074724","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world-wide emergency. Fangcang shelter hospitals have been applied in COVID-19 to ease ongoing shortage of medical resources in Wuhan since February 2020. Methods This study enrolled all cases (no=1848) with mild or moderate type of COVID-19 in Fangcang shelter hospital of Jianghan in Wuhan from Feb 5th to Mar 9th, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the National health commission of China. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs, symptoms and signs were recorded in detail. Laboratory tests included biochemical indicators and nucleic acid tests by throat swabs have been performed as well. Findings A total of 1327 patients reached the criteria of isolation release. Meanwhile, 521 patients have been transferred to the designated hospitals for further treatment, including severe type, fever more than 3 days, and severe comorbidity. The case-severity rate (rate of mild or moderate type transforming to severe type) was 3.0% in the shelter hospital. The patients from mild or moderate type to severe type showed the following clinical characteristics: the median incubation (onset to shelter) period was 10 days; they were all symptomatic at admission; fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms; hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart diseases were common co-morbidities; most of the patients had elevated levels of CRP at ill onset with 33.3% over 10 mg per L; bilateral distribution and ground-glass opacity were the most common manifestations in chest CT. Interpretation The potential risk factors of fever, fatigue, high level of C-reactive protein were the risk factors to identify the progression of COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate type. Fangcang shelter hospitals have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms transfer to a designated hospital. Early application of the Fangcang shelter hospital may contribute to decrease the ratio of mild transforming to severe patients. Funding No specific grant from any funding was applied to this research.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunfei Liao","author_inst":"Union Hospital,Tongji Medical College,
