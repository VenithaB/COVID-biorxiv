In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set. Adherence to infection control guidelines such as but not limited to frequently handwashing for at least 20 seconds, observing coughing etiquette, wearing of masks, and social distancing should be maintained in order to contain the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Marcos Alipio","author_inst":"Davao Doctors College"},{"author_name":"Joseph Dave Mendoza Pregoner","author_inst":"University of the Immaculate Conception"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20048025","rel_title":"Further analysis of the impact of distancing upon the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20048025","rel_abs":"This paper questions various claims from the paper \"Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic\" by Kissler, Tedijanto, Lipsitch, and Grad: most importantly, the claim that China's \"intense\" distancing measures achieved only a 60% reduction in R0.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel J.

However, little is known about the epidemiology and burden of severe COVID-19 to inform planning within healthcare systems and modeling of intervention impact. Methods: We assessed incidence, duration of hospitalization, and clinical outcomes of acute COVID-19 inpatient admissions in a prospectively-followed cohort of 9,596,321 individuals enrolled in comprehensive, integrated healthcare delivery plans from Kaiser Permanente in California and Washington state. We also estimated the effective reproductive number (RE) describing transmission in the study populations. Results: Data covered 1277 hospitalized patients with laboratory- or clinically-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by April 9, 2020. Cumulative incidence of first COVID-19 acute inpatient admission was 10.6-12.4 per 100,000 cohort members across the study regions. Mean censoring-adjusted duration of hospitalization was 10.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 0.8-30.1) among survivors and 13.7 days (2.5-97.5%iles: 1.7-34.6) among non-survivors. Among all hospitalized confirmed cases, censoring-adjusted probabilities of ICU admission and mortality were 41.9% (95% confidence interval: 34.1-51.4%) and 17.8% (14.3-22.2%), respectively, and higher among men than women. We estimated RE was 1.43 (1.17-1.73), 2.09 (1.63-2.69), and 1.47 (0.07-2.59) in Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, respectively, for infections acquired March 1, 2020. RE declined to 0.98 (0.76-1.27), 0.89 (0.74-1.06), and 0.92 (0.05-1.55) respectively, for infections acquired March 20, 2020. Conclusions: We identify high probability of ICU admission, long durations of stay, and considerable mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 cases in the western United States. Reductions in RE have occurred in conjunction with implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph A Lewnard","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Vincent X Liu","author_inst":"Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Health Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark A Schmidt","author_inst":"Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest"},{"author_name":"Britta L Jewell","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Jean P Flores","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Chris Jentz","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Arthur L Reingold","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Jewell","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Scott Young","author_inst":"The Permanente Foundation, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Jim Bellows","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063669","rel_title":"Smoking is Associated with COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063669","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19. Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers. Data Source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. Main Outcome Measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roengrudee Patanavanich","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Stanton A Glantz","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Health Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark A Schmidt","author_inst":"Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest"},{"author_name":"Britta L Jewell","author_inst":"Imperial College, London"},{"author_name":"Jean P Flores","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Chris Jentz","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Arthur L Reingold","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Jewell","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Scott Young","author_inst":"The Permanente Foundation, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Jim Bellows","author_inst":"The Care Management Institute, Kaiser Permanente"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062026","rel_title":"Vapor H2O2 sterilization as a decontamination method for the reuse of N95 respirators in the COVID-19 emergency","rel_date":"2020-04-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062026","rel_abs":"There are a variety of methods routinely used in the sterilization of medical devices using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) including vaporization, plasma generation and ionization.

COVID19 associated delayed phase thrombocytopenia was occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolled patients. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher ICU admission rate. Delayed phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a high and significantly negative linear correlation with B cell percentages and serum IL 6 levels. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes.

Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG \/ IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%. Regarding group 3 patients, the median days from onset of symptoms was 17 and the test was positive in 56 out of 63 patients (88.9% positivity rate). In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe Perez Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Ramon Perez Tanoira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Pedro Romanyk Cabrera","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias y Universidad de Alcala de Henares"},{"author_name":"Teresa Arroyo Serrano","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Pe\u00f1a Gomez Herruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Cuadros Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias y Universidad de Alcala de Henares"},{"author_name":"Claude Kwe Yinda","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Seifert","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Amandine Gamble","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Seth Judson","author_inst":"UW"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lloyd-Smith","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Brandon Emmal","author_inst":"B & V Testing"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062380","rel_title":"The clinical characteristics and mortal causes analysis of COVID-19 death patients","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062380","rel_abs":"Abstract Purpose: Currently, COVID-19 is causing a large number of deaths globally. However, few researches focused on the clinical features of death patients. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and mortal causes in Chinese COVID-19 death patients. Patients and methods: The clinical characteristics of death patients were collected from publicized by local health authorities in China. Expressions of virus targets in human organs were obtained from GTEx database. Results: 159 patients from 24 provinces in China were recruited in our study, including 26 young patients under 60 and 133 aged 60 or older. The median age was 71 years, which indicated that most death patients were elderly. More male patients died of COVID-19 than females (1.65 fold). Hypertension was the most common coexisting disorder and respiratory failure was the most common direct cause of death. Fever (71.19%) and cough (55.08%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. There was one asymptomatic patient. In addition, by comparing young and old patients, heart disease was identified as an important risk factor for death in the aged patients. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were the targets of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed their expression in different organs. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 had a high expression in the organs which had corresponding clinical features in death patients. Conclusion: Male, age and heart disease were the main risk factors of death. Beside, asymptomatic patients with serious coexisting disorders may also die of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, more attention should be paid to the old patients with heart disease and asymptomatic patients in the treatment .

Methods: All close contacts of the patient were screened since the first supermarket employee with COVID-19 was identified. A retrospective analysis was made on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the confirmed cases admitted to the designated hospitals for centralized treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to the first generation (supermarket employees, group A) and the second or third generation (family members or friends of supermarket employees, group B), and the similarities and differences between the two groups were compared. Results: A total of 24 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed, with an average age of 48{+\/-}1.73 years. The mean duration from onset to release form quarantine was 21.04{+\/-}6.77 days, and the onset time was concentrated in 5-11 days after the first patient was diagnosed. Among all the patients, 23 patients were moderate, among which 7 patients (29.17%) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of symptomatic patients were cough (75.00%), low fever (62.50%), shortness of breath (41.67%), sore throat (25.00%), gastrointestinal symptoms (25.00%), fatigue (20.83%), etc. Biochemical examination on admission showed that the white blood cell count < 4.010x9\/L (29.17%) and the lymphocyte count <1.1x109\/L (58.33%). The lymphocyte count of 50.00% of the patients was [&le;]0.6x109\/L. On admission, chest CT showed pneumonia (100%) with bilateral infiltration (75.00%). Treatment: antiviral drug (100%), Chinese medicine (100%), common oxygen therapy (45.83%). There were 11 cases in group A (first generation, 11 cases) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases). In group B, there were more males, from onset to admission later, more patients had underlying diseases, and more patients were treated with albumin (P<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in other clinical indicators, including the duration from onset to release form quarantine(P>0.05). There was no improvement in granulocyte count in all patients, as well as in groups A and B, between admission and release from quarantine(P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster were similar to those of other COVID-19 patients, but there were some special features. The severity of the disease was similar and there was intergenerational spread. There was no difference in clinical characteristics between generations. Asymptomatic infections occurred in a proportion of patients and could cause spread.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suochen Tian","author_inst":"Liaocheng people's hospital, Shandong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Healthcare Associated Infection, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenqin Chang","author_inst":"Department of  Hemodialysis, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Yunxia Wang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Guijie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Junmin Xing","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Tian","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xihong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Zou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Liu","author_inst":"Intelligence Library Center,  Liaocheng people's hospital,  Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Han","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuangfeng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Central laboratory, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062042","rel_title":"Human agency and infection rates: implications for social distancing during epidemics","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062042","rel_abs":"Social distancing is an important measure in controlling epidemics. This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Bronk Ramsey","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Healthcare Associated Infection, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenqin Chang","author_inst":"Department of  Hemodialysis, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Yunxia Wang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Guijie Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng Infectious Diseases Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Junmin Xing","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Tian","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xihong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Zou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Liu","author_inst":"Intelligence Library Center,  Liaocheng people's hospital,  Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Han","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuangfeng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Central laboratory, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062133","rel_title":"Intervention strategies against COVID-19 and their estimated impact on Swedish healthcare capacity","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062133","rel_abs":"Objectives: During March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread globally, and non-pharmaceutical interventions are being used to reduce both the load on the healthcare system as well as overall mortality. Design: Individual-based transmission modelling using Swedish demographic and Geographical Information System data and conservative COVID-19 epidemiological parameters. Setting: Sweden Participants: A model to simulate all 10.09 million Swedish residents. Interventions: 5 different non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions including the mitigation strategy of the Swedish government as of 10 April; isolation of the entire household of confirmed cases; closure of schools and non-essential businesses with or without strict social distancing; and strict social distancing with closure of schools and non-essential businesses. Main outcome measures: Estimated acute care and intensive care hospitalisations, COVID-19 attributable deaths, and infections among healthcare workers from 10 April until 29 June. Findings: Our model for Sweden shows that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, the current Swedish public-health strategy will result in a peak intensive-care load in May that exceeds pre-pandemic capacity by over 40-fold, with a median mortality of 96,000 (95% CI 52,000 to 183,000). The most stringent public-health measures examined are predicted to reduce mortality by approximately three-fold. Intensive-care load at the peak could be reduced by over two-fold with a shorter period at peak pandemic capacity. Conclusions: Our results predict that, under conservative epidemiological parameter estimates, current measures in Sweden will result in at least 40-fold over-subscription of pre-pandemic Swedish intensive care capacity, with 15.8 percent of Swedish healthcare workers unable to work at the pandemic peak. Modifications to ICU admission criteria from international norms would further increase mortality.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmine M Gardner","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Wouter van der Wijngaart","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shina Caroline Lynn Kamerlin","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Nele Brusselaers","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia \/ Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Junmin Xing","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Tian","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xihong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuli Zou","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Liu","author_inst":"Intelligence Library Center,  Liaocheng people's hospital,  Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Han","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, The Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of TCM, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Kang Ning","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, 250000, China"},{"author_name":"Shuangfeng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Central laboratory, Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062190","rel_title":"Estimating the real-time case fatality rate of COVID-19 using Poisson mixtures model","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20062190","rel_abs":"Importance: The case fatality rate (CFR) estimation during the early stage of a disease outbreak is important, but the current estimation methods are heavily biased.

The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen, remains elusive. Methods: Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. Results: A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI: 0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly ([&ge;]60 years old). There was no gender difference in the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51-0.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in about 1 week. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the elderly [&ge;]60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qin-Long Jing","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ming-Jin Liu","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Yuan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhou-Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"An-Ran Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Natalie E Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Meng-Meng Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ira Longini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Eben Kenah","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Ying Lu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Neda Jalali","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Li-Qun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Cong Yang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061267","rel_title":"Public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A UK-based focus group study","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061267","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: Explore the perceptions and experiences of the UK public of social distancing and social isolation measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative study comprising five focus groups carried out online during the early stages of the UK's social distancing and isolation measures (5-12 days post lockdown). SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: The social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had having substantial negative impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of the UK public within a short time of policy implementation. It has disproportionately negatively affected those in low-paid or precarious employment. Practical social and economic losses - the loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine - led to psychological and emotional 'losses' - the loss of motivation, loss of meaning, and loss of self-worth. Participants reported high adherence to distancing and isolation guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others. A central concern for participants was the uncertainty duration of the measures, and their ability to cope longer-term. Some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Initial high levels of support for, and adherence to, social distancing and isolation is likely to wane over time, particularly where end dates are uncertain. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon N Williams","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Armitage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Tova Tampe","author_inst":"Independent Consultant, World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Dienes","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"An-Ran Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Natalie E Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Meng-Meng Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ira Longini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Eben Kenah","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Ying Lu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Neda Jalali","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Li-Qun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Cong Yang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Tiejun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Unit,  Liaocheng people's hospital, Liaocheng,  Shandong, 252000, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061697","rel_title":"Surveillance by age-class and prefecture for emerging infectious febrile diseases with respiratory symptoms, including COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061697","rel_abs":"Object The COVID-19 outbreak emerged in late 2019 in China, expanding rapidly thereafter. Even in Japan, epidemiological linkage of transmission was probably lost already by February 18, 2020. From that time, it has been necessary to detect clusters using syndromic surveillance. Method We identified common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, we constructed a model to predict the number of patients with antipyretic analgesics (AP) and multi-ingredient cold medications (MIC) controlling well-known pediatric infectious diseases including influenza or RS virus infection. To do so, we used the National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases (NOSSID), even though NOSSID data are weekly data with 10 day delays, on average. The probability of a cluster with unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptoms is a product of the probabilities of aberrations in AP and MIC, which is defined as one minus the probability of the number of patients prescribed a certain type of drug in PS compared to the number predicted using a model. This analysis was conducted prospectively in 2020 using data from October 1, 2010 through 2019 by prefecture and by age-class. Results The probability of unknown febrile disease with respiratory symptom cluster was estimated as less than 60% in 2020. Discussion The most severe limitation of the present study is that the proposed model cannot be validated.

Upon observing a cluster of COVID-19 cases from a single large homeless shelter in Boston, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program conducted symptom assessments and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 among all guests residing at the shelter over a 2-day period. Of 408 participants, 147 (36.0%) were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-positive individuals were more likely to be male (p<0.001) but did not differ significantly from COVID-negative individuals with respect to other demographic and clinical characteristics. Cough (7.5%), shortness of breath (1.4%), and fever (0.7%) were all uncommon among COVID-positive individuals. Our findings illustrate the rapidity with which COVID-19 can be widely transmitted in a homeless shelter setting and suggest that universal PCR testing, rather than a symptom triggered approach, may be a better strategy for identifying and mitigating COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Travis P.

Design : Systematic review Data sources:We searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto 31st March 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for \" coronavirus \" or \" COVID-19 \" or \" severe acute respiratory syndrome \" or \" SARS-COV-2 \" and \" pregnancy \" . We also included data from preprint articles. Study selection : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction : We included 23 studies [China (20), USA (01), Republic of Korea (01) and Honduras, Central America (01) reporting the information on 172 pregnant women and 162 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also recorded. Results: Out of 172 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 160 women had delivered 162 newborns (2 set of twins, 12 ongoing pregnancies). In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common symptoms were fever (54%), cough (35%), myalgia (17%), dyspnea (12%) and diarrhea (4%). Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 100 % of COVID-19 pregnant women. Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (89%), preterm labor (21%), fetal distress (9%) and premature rupture of membranes (8%). The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were diabetes (11%), hypertensive disorders (9%), placental disorders (5%), co-infections (6%), scarred uterus (5%), hypothyroidism (5%) and anemia (4%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers, preterm birth (23%), respiratory distress syndrome (14%), pneumonia (14%) low birth weight (11%), small for gestational age (3%) were reported. There was one still birth and one neonatal death reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 11%. Conclusion In pregnant women with COVID-19, diabetes and hypertensive disorders are common co-morbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery. Amongst the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common occurrence. There is an evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Gajbhiye","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health"},{"author_name":"Deepak Modi","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health"},{"author_name":"Smita Mahale","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health"},{"author_name":"Jessie M.

No clear path exists, however, for introducing a locally fabricated and unapproved product into a clinical setting. In a US health care setting, face shields are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); similar policies exist in other countries. We describe a research protocol under which rapid iteration on an existing design, coupled with clinical feedback and real-world testing in an emergency department, allowed a face shield to be adopted by the incident command team at a major academic medical center. We describe our design and testing process and provide an overview of regulatory considerations associated with fabrication and testing of face shields and related products. All designs, materials used, testing protocols, and survey results are reported in full to facilitate the execution of similar face shield efforts in other clinical settings.

Objective: To analyze the change in video visit volume at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and compare demographics\/appointment data from January 1, 2020 and in the 11 weeks after transition to video visits. Methods: Patient demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and departments) were abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database. Video visits were performed using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with a pre-existing workflow. Results: In 17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center, 2,284 video visits were performed in the 11 weeks before COVID-19 changes with an average (SD) of 208 (75) per week and 12,946 video visits were performed in the 11 week post-COVID-19 period with an average (SD) of 1,177 (120) per week. The proportion of video visits increased from 7-18% to 54-72%, between the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods without any disparity based on race\/ethnicity, primary language, or payor.

We wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing. Methods: We recruited individuals recently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through a testing program (drive-through). In homes of participants, we assessed the performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens with and without clinician supervision, clinician-supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (nasal) swab specimens, and clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We tested specimens with a validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measured cycle threshold values. Symptom status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant. Results: We recruited 45 participants. The median age of study participant was 42 years old (Interquartile range, 31 to 52 years). Of the participants, 29 had at least one specimen test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 21 (73%) of 29 reported active symptoms. By specimen type and home-based collection method, clinician-supervised self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 26 (90%) of 29 infected individuals, clinician-supervised self-collected nasal swab specimens detected 23 (85%) of 27, clinician-collected posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens detected 23 (79%) of 29, and unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 19 (66%) of 29. Despite nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the gold standard, 4 participants tested negative by clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab and positive by the 3 other specimen types. Additionally, false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap. Conclusions: Supervised self-collected oral fluid and nasal swab specimens performed similarly to, if not better than clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sample type captured all SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals. Supervised self-collection performed comparably to clinician collection and would allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity in the United States by reducing the need for trained healthcare workers, reducing exposure of healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) being used for testing during a critical shortage.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noah Kojima","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fred Turner","author_inst":"Curative Inc"},{"author_name":"Vlad Slepnev","author_inst":"Curative Inc"},{"author_name":"Agatha Bacelar","author_inst":"Curative Inc"},{"author_name":"Laura Deming","author_inst":"Curative Inc"},{"author_name":"Siri Kodeboyina","author_inst":"Curative Inc"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D Klausner","author_inst":"UCLA Health"},{"author_name":"Mihai G.

The healthcare system in India faces an acute shortage of front-line doctors to fight the Covid-19. Thus, the recruitment of undergraduate medical students into the health care force is being considered by many state governments. A survey was conducted amongst undergraduate medical students to understand their knowledge, attitude, and preparedness towards the ongoing pandemic. Methods. An anonymized survey on a cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) comprising 33 questions was served to medical students. Results. Of 616 (24.6%) respondents among 2500 invitees across six medical schools in India, most (54.1%) were in the final year of their undergraduate training program. Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, and drugs being tried out in Covid-19 was adequate among most students. However, understanding of the incubation period 123 (20%) and time to symptoms 30 (4.8%) was less than satisfactory. Three-fourths (75%) were unaware of the treatment guidelines for Covid-19, and one-quarter (155, 25.1%) were unaware of the required precautions during management. Moreover, 179 (29.1%) were unaware that Covid-19 causes an asymptomatic or minor illness in young individuals. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Besides, 250 (40.6%) were not updated on Covid-19, and most (486, 78.9%) resorted to social media for information on Covid-19. Conclusion. Prevalent fears and inadequate understanding of Covid-19 suggest that undergraduate medical students are not prepared to be the front-line taskforce in the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishwesh Agarwal","author_inst":"Mahatma Gandhi Missions Medical College, Navi Mumbai"},{"author_name":"Latika Gupta","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Sciences, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Samira Davalbhakta","author_inst":"Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College, Pune"},{"author_name":"Durga Misra","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Sciences, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Vikas Agarwal","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Sciences, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Ashish Goel","author_inst":"University College Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D Klausner","author_inst":"UCLA Health"},{"author_name":"Mihai G.

Here, in this manuscript, we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization via obtaining the comprehensive genome sequence. Following the CDC health and safety guidelines, we test the concept using the culturing supernatant contain SARS-CoV-2 particles, and its full-length sequence was used for further analysis. The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA was 93.47% with Cluster Factor about 1.1, which demonstrate that the numbers of mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. Moreover, based on the high-quality sequence, we discussed the heterozygosity and viral expression during replication of coronavirus, and its phylogenetic relationship with other selected high-quality samples from The Genome Variation Map (GVM) (on 2020\/03\/22). We believe this manuscript is valuable for all the researchers who are interested in using clinical warp samples to obtain the high coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with a relatively low concentration of viral particles. This would allow the clinician to correlate the diagnostic data with molecular monitoring in viral evolutional, the most importantly, to track the functional mutation of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"shaoqing wen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Regeneration Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Samira Davalbhakta","author_inst":"Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College, Pune"},{"author_name":"Durga Misra","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Sciences, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Vikas Agarwal","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Sciences, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Ashish Goel","author_inst":"University College Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D Klausner","author_inst":"UCLA Health"},{"author_name":"Mihai G.
