The government of various countries, their citizens, politicians, and business owners are worried about the unavoidable economic impacts of this pandemic. Therefore, there is an eagerness for the pandemic peaking. Objectives: This study uses an objective approach to emphasize the need to be pragmatic with easing of lockdowns measures worldwide through the forecast of the possible trend of COVID-19. This is necessary to ensure that the enthusiasm about SARS-CoV-2 peaking is properly examined, easing of lockdown is done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. Methods: We used the Facebook prophet on the World Health Organization data for COVID-19 to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the 7th April until 3rd May 2020. The forecast model was further used to forecast the trend of the virus for the 8th until 14th May 2020. We presented the forecast of the confirmed and death cases. Results: Our findings from the forecast showed an increase in the number of new cases for this period. Therefore, the need for easing the lockdown with caution becomes imperative. Our model showed good performance when compared to the official report from the World Health Organization. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.6%. Conclusion: Although, the global and economic impact of COVID-19 is daunting. However, excessive optimism about easing the lockdown should be appropriately weighed against the risk of underestimating its spread. As seen globally, the risks appeared far from being symmetric. Therefore, the forecasting provided in this study offers an insight into the spread of the virus for effective planning and decision-making in terms of easing the lockdowns in various countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rasheed Omobolaji Alabi","author_inst":"University of Vaasa"},{"author_name":"Akpojoto Siemuri","author_inst":"University of Vaasa"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Elmusrati","author_inst":"University of Vaasa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0_ng","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.10.20097063","rel_title":"Automatic Detection of COVID-19 Infection from Chest X-ray using Deep Learning","rel_date":"2020-05-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.10.20097063","rel_abs":"COVID-19 infection has created a panic across the globe in recent times.

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa. Methods: We downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https:\/\/covid19.who.int\/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software. Results: We plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [&ge;] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu-Chang Hu","author_inst":"National Taiwan University, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Md.

At present neither vaccination nor therapies are available although several antiviral agents such as remdesivir, originally an Ebola drug, nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and other drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from three studies employing human lung epithelial cells. Of these one focused on lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed at identifying genes co-expressed with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the human cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and unveiled several genes correlated or inversely correlated with high significance, among the most significant of these was the transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4). Serine proteases are known to be involved in the infection process by priming the virus spike protein. Pathway analysis revealed papilloma virus infection amongst the most significantly correlated pathways. Gene Ontologies revealed regulation of viral life cycle, immune responses, pro-inflammatory responses-several interleukins such as IL6, IL1, IL20 and IL33, IFI16 regulating the interferon response to a virus, chemo-attraction of macrophages, last and not least cellular stress resulting from activated Reactive Oxygen Species.

The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity.\n\nMethodsWe have developed an online tool for SARS-CoV-2 research, which combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, with an updated variant database (55,944 non-synonymous mutations) based on 16,087 whole genome sequences, and an analysis of human coronavirus homology. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which are candidate vaccine and serological diagnostic targets.\n\nResultsOur analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. Whilst, a further analysis suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic assays.\n\nConclusionsThe tool can be accessed online (http:\/\/genomics.lshtm.ac.uk\/immuno) and will serve as a useful tool for biological discovery in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, it may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including new human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Ward","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Higgins","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jody Phelan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin L.

The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is important in responding and controlling the pandemic. Recent research results suggest that bats or pangolins might be the original hosts for the virus based on comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the COVID-19 virus origin by using artificial intelligence (AI) and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that all examined COVID-19 virus genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidences strongly supporting scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for the COVID-19 virus. At the whole genome analysis level, our findings also indicate that bats are more likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thanh Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Abdelrazek","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Dung Tien Nguyen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Sunil Aryal","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Duc Thanh Nguyen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Amin Khatami","author_inst":"Deakin University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20094755","rel_title":"Beneficial effect of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a propensity score matching analysis.","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20094755","rel_abs":"Background. Since December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is spreading worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. No specific treatment has yet clearly shown to improve the disease's evolution. Validated therapeutic options are urgently needed. Methods. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate determinants of the prognosis of the disease in 70 patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia (i.e. requiring at least 3 liters of oxygen) hospitalized between 10 March and 9 April, 2020, in the Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman, France. The main outcome was oro-tracheal intubation and the exposure of interest was corticotherapy. Since this was not a randomized trial, we used propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effect. Results. There was evidence that corticotherapy lowered the risk of intubation with a risk difference of -47.1% (95% confidence interval -71.8% to -22.5%). Conclusion. Corticosteroid, a well-known, easily available, and cheap treatment, could be an important tool in management of severe COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. Not only could it provide an individual benefit, but also, in the setting of the COVID-19 ongoing pandemic, lower the burden on our vulnerable healthcare systems.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomasz Chroboczek","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Marie Lacoste","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Chloe Wackenheim","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Thibaut Challan-Belval","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Amar","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Thomas Boisson","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Jason Hubac","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Dominique Leduc","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Colleen Masse","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Victor Dechaene","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Touhiri-Maximin","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Megessier","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Camille Lassale","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092452","rel_title":"Identification of Immune complement function as a determinant of adverse SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092452","rel_abs":"Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vijendra Ramlall","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Phyllis Thangaraj","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Cem Meydan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Foox","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Butler","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben May","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jessica de Freitas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin S Glicksberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mason","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Tatonetti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sagi D Shapira","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Megessier","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Alpes Leman"},{"author_name":"Camille Lassale","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20091447","rel_title":"Rapid response flow cytometric assay for the detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20091447","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a previously unknown zoonotic coronavirus that spread worldwide causing a serious pandemic.

Therefore, this strategy can be explored as an early intervention in managing patients in early stage of disease development under the context of pandemic and limited medical resources.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Dong","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Yiping Gong","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Feng","author_inst":"1.\tDepartment of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,Wuhan,Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Lang Bai","author_inst":"1.Center of Infectious Diseases, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.D"},{"author_name":"Junchen Zhu","author_inst":"1.Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan Universi"},{"author_name":"Shanling Xu","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ziquan Lv","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guohong Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095877","rel_title":"Forecasting Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in India under Various Containment Measures- A Time-Dependent State-Space SIR Approach","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095877","rel_abs":"Objectives Our primary objective is to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India while adjusting for the effects of various progressively implemented containment measures. Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. Methods We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Results Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period. Conclusions Estimated modifiers give consistent estimates of unadjusted R0 across different scenarios, demonstrating precision. Results corroborate the effectiveness of lockdown measures in substantially reducing R0. Also, predictions are highly sensitive towards estimate of infectious period.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vishal Deo","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anuradha Rajkonwar Chetiya","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of delhi"},{"author_name":"Barnali Deka","author_inst":"Ramjas College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gurprit Grover","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China;

An exhaustive statistical analysis encompassing arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, standard deviation, skewness, variance, Pearson and Spearman correlation was derived from the data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in details. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby the Atangana-Seda numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for different non-integer numbers. Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in details.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdon ATANGANA","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF FREE STATE"},{"author_name":"Seda IGRET ARAZ","author_inst":"Siirt university"},{"author_name":"Qiu Yuqing","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Samore","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Haomiao Qing","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Peng Zhou","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, "},{"author_name":"Yu Du","author_inst":"1.Emergency department and intensive care unit, West China School of Public Health, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.D"},{"author_name":"Junchen Zhu","author_inst":"1.Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2.Department of Infectious Disease, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan Universi"},{"author_name":"Shanling Xu","author_inst":"1.Critical Care Medicine Department, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Techno"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ziquan Lv","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shuyuan Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Wen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guohong Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tianmu Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095471","rel_title":"Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Convalescent Plasma in Houston, Texas","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095471","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, and no proven treatments are available. Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for more than 100 years. Methods: Patients (n=25) with severe and\/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to April 14, 2020. Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma obtained from donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had been symptom free for 14 days. The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 post-transfusion. Clinical improvement was assessed based on a modified World Health Organization 6-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters. Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains. Results: At baseline, all patients were receiving supportive care, including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral treatments, and all patients were on oxygen support. At day 7 post-transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged. By day 14 post-transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical status and 11 were discharged. No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed. The whole genome sequencing data did not identify a strain genotype-disease severity correlation. Conclusions: The data indicate that administration of convalescent plasma is a safe treatment option for those with severe COVID-19 disease. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine its efficacy.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Salazar","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katherine K.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and employ systems that effectively manage the demand for services. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of the first five weeks of a 24\/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline. Design: Cohort study using electronic health records. Setting: A single large health care system in Northeast Ohio. Participants: During 5 weeks of operation, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers) and were evaluated by a registered nurse (RN) using standardized protocols. Of these, 4,213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). The mean age of callers was 42 years. 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid or uninsured. Intervention: Physician telehealth visits for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race\/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. Results: Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 (7%) patients had a subsequent ED visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency room use (OR=4.73, 95%CI 1.37-16.39, p=.014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Conclusions and Relevance: Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Margolius","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Mary Hennekes","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Yaho","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Douglas Einstadter","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Douglas Gunzler","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of suspect cases of COVID-19 in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico, and to compare their characteristics with those of non-migrants. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of information from the surveillance system of Mexico from January 1 to May 3 2020, identifying persons from the main sending countries of mixed migrant flows in Mexico (Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela and African countries), in northern and southern Mexican border states. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics, risk conditions, and epidemic curves for migrants and non-migrants. Also, we estimated the cumulative incidence for non-migrants, and for migrants in two scenarios defined by different estimations of their population size. RESULTS: Migrants were on average younger, had less accompanying risk conditions, and a lower percentage of suspect cases tested positive for COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization were lower among migrants, but the difference disappeared after adjusting by age, gender and underlying risk conditions. The cumulative incidence ratios comparing migrants with non-migrants were 6.12 (CI95% 4.75,7.77) for the first scenario, and 1.49 (CI95% 1.15,1.89) for the second scenario. CONCLUSION: Migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico are at increased risk for infectious respiratory diseases, and could be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. It is important to continue monitoring the situation, with more detailed information about migration status, living conditions and other determinants of migrants health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ietza Bojorquez","author_inst":"El Colegio de la Frontera Norte"},{"author_name":"Cesar Infante","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica"},{"author_name":"Isabel Vieitez","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Silvana Larrea","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Reporting artefacts and missing data about asymptomatic spreaders, imply considerable margins of uncertainty for model-based predictions. Epidemiological models can however also be used to investigate the consequences of measures to control the pandemic, reflected in changes to parameter values. We present a SIR-based, SUIR model in which the influence of testing and a reduction of contacts is studied by distinguishing 'Unidentified' and 'Identified' spreaders of infections. The model uses four ordinary differential equations and is kept deliberately simple to investigate general patterns occurring from testing and contact restrictions. The model goes beyond other efforts, by introducing time dependent parameter curves that represent different strategies in controlling the pandemic. Our analysis reveals the effect of 'pro-active' testing for the design of contact restriction measures. By pro-active testing we mean testing beyond those people who show symptoms. The simulations can explain why the timing of contract restrictions and pro-active testing is important. The model can also be used to study the consequence of different strategies to exit from lockdown. Our SUIR model is implemented in Python and is made available through a Juypter Notebooks. This an extensive documentation of the derivation and implementation of the model, as well as transparent and reproducible simulation studies. Our model should contribute to a better understanding of the role of testing and contact restrictions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saptarshi Bej","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Olaf Wolkenhauer","author_inst":"University of Rostock"},{"author_name":"Isabel Vieitez","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Silvana Larrea","author_inst":"Population Council"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

The first incident of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India was reported on 30 January 2020, which was a student from Wuhan. The number of reported cases has started to increase day by day after 30 February 2020. The purpose of this investigation is to provide a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in India by utilizing real-time data from 30 February to 14 April 2020. We apply the well-known epidemic compartmental model \"SEIR\" to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19, India. Since we do not have the complete detail of the infective population, using the available infected population data, we identify the R0 by using polynomial regression. By using the third-order polynomial equation, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in India is R0 = 3.3 (95%CI, 3.1 to 3.5), and the epidemic peak could be reached by September 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"R V Belfin","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Piotr Brodka","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"BL Radhakrishnan","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"V Rejula","author_inst":"Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santoro","author_inst":"Medicos del Mundo"},{"author_name":"Nabil Chehade","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Ashwini R Sehgal","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

To determine whether COVID-19 prevalence is modulated by meteorological conditions, meta-regression of Japanese prefectural data was herein conducted. We extracted integrated number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 in each Japanese prefecture on 18 May 2020, population per 1-km2 inhabitable area in the prefecture in 2020, and monthly meteorological conditions at each prefectural capital city for 4 months (from January to April 2020). We averaged or cumulated the monthly data for the 4 months. To adjust for prefectural population density, we defined the COVID-19 prevalence as the integrated number of patients testing positive divided by the population per 100-km2 inhabitable area. Random-effects meta-regression was performed. A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative for mean air temperature (coefficient, -0.134; P = 0.019), mean sea level air pressure (-0.351; P = 0.001), and mean daily maximum UV index (-0.908; P = 0.012), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence decreased significantly as air temperature, air pressure, and UV index increased. In conclusion, higher temperature, pressure, and UV may be associated with less COVID-19 prevalence, which should be confirmed by further epidemiological investigations taking other risk and protective factors of COVID-19 into account.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yujiro Yokoyama","author_inst":"Easton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from 9.9 x 10^2 to 1.2 x 10^8 copies\/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zohaib Khurshid","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Sana Zohaib","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Joshi","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Syed Faraz Moin","author_inst":"University of Karachi"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Sohail Zafar","author_inst":"Taibah University"},{"author_name":"David J Speicher","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFN{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huarong Chen","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Weixin Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Dabin Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Liuyang Zhao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jun Yu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"David J Speicher","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yasir Tarabichi","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"Adam T Perzynski","author_inst":"The MetroHealth System"},{"author_name":"S.

Healthcare providers are at increased risks of infection when caring for patients with COVID-19. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. However, there is growing evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to direct droplet spread and indirect contact. Here, we report on the design, construction, and testing of the BADGER (Box for Aerosol and Droplet Guarding and Evacuation in Respiratory Infection), an affordable, scalable device that can contain droplets and aerosol particles. The BADGER has multiple hand-ports for healthcare providers to perform essential tasks on a patient's airway and head. A semi-sealed environment is created inside the BADGER, which maintains at least twelve-air changes per hour using in-wall vacuum suction. Qualitative testing demonstrates that under conditions typical of non-invasive supplemental oxygen treatment, the BADGER can contain nebulized denatonium benzoate and smoke. Quantitative aerosol testing shows more than 90% containment of sub-micrometer aerosolized particles. Overall, the BADGER has the potential to contain large droplets and small airborne particles, and to provide an additional layer of protection for healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hau D.

The elevation of cytokines in blood is crucial to induce cytokine storm and immunosuppression in the transition of severity in COVID-19 patients. However, the comprehensive changes of serum proteins in COVID-19 patients throughout the SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. In this work, we developed a high-density antibody microarray and performed an in-depth proteomics analysis of serum samples collected from early COVID-19 (n=15) and influenza (n=13) patients. We identified a large set of differentially expressed proteins (n=125) that participate in a landscape of inflammation and immune signaling related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the significant correlations of neutrophil and lymphocyte with the CCL2 and CXCL10 mediated cytokine signaling pathways was identified. These information are valuable for the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, identification of biomarkers and development of the optimal anti-inflammation therapy.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Xian Wu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Minya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Dan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Meng Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: University of Chicago Medicine Participants: Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3\/3\/2020-4\/10\/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20ng\/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <18pg\/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient(last-level-deficient\/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient\/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient\/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient\/treatment-decreased). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Results: Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age<50)=1.05,p<0.021;RR(age[&ge;]50)=1.02,p<0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p<0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient\/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p<0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient\/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David O Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Thomas J Best","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Tamara Vokes","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vineet Arora","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Julian Solway","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe hypoxemia was 0.95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2.9 micromol\/L. By linear regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2\/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully employed to stratify patients and monitor disease. Severe hypoferraemia may plausibly impair critical iron-dependent processes such as lymphocyte responses and hypoxia sensing, contributing to pathology, and is potentially treatable.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Joe Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise Aaron","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Killian Donovan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

A large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi-logarithmic plots, for a selection of thirty-two countries from the five continents. Three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave: a pre-epidemic regime 1, an exponential-growth regime 2, and a resorption regime 3. A two-parameters scaling of the first-wave death variation reported in China is used to fit those reported in other countries. Comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries, which are classified in four groups, from group A where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently, to group D where the pandemic first waves widely spread. Group A is mainly composed of Asian countries, where fast and efficient measures have been applied. Group D is composed of Western-Europe countries and the United States of America, where late decisions and confused political communication (pandemic seriousness, protection masks, herd immunity etc.) led to significant death tolls. The threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed, in particular for the countries from group D, where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of May 2020. The situation is opposite in Asian countries from group A, where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level. In particular, the results obtained by Hong Kong and South Korea are highlighted, and the measures taken there are presented as virtuous examples that other countries may follow.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Knafo","author_inst":"CNRS\/LNCMI"},{"author_name":"Joe Frost","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise Aaron","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Killian Donovan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

The serious limitations of using crude COVID-19 CFRs for comparisons between countries have been addressed in the literature but are often overlooked or misunderstood, both in the scientific literature and in the media. In this paper we examined the extent to which age distribution of the cases is responsible for the differences in CFRs between countries. Methods Data on COVID-19 were extracted from the reports of individual countries. Overall and age-specific CFRs were available for six countries. The CFRs by country were adjusted for age using the direct method, using the combined age-specific number of cases of all six countries as the standard population. Findings The age distribution of the cases varied widely between countries. The crude CFRs varied between 1.6% and 11%. The differences in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller and the age-adjusted rates were much closer than the crude rates. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest CFR to that with the lowest, was reduced substantially for the age-adjusted rates, from 7.4 to 2.3 Conclusions The age structure of the cases dramatically impacts on the differences in the crude CFRs between countries. Adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the differences in the definition of the denominators, the definition of a case and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation. It is misleading to compare the crude COVID-19 CFRs between countries and should be avoided. At the very least, comparisons should be based on age-specific and age-adjusted rates.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manfred S Green","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Victoria Peer","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Naama Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Dorit Nitzan","author_inst":"World Health Organization, European Region"},{"author_name":"Stuart McKechnie","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.

High mobility between areas contribute to the importation of cases, affecting the spread of the disease. While many factors influence local incidence and making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can give rise to autonomous outbreaks that impact separate areas of the contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost local incidence and size, making control and tracing measures less effective. In Spain, the high heterogeneity in incidence between similar areas despite the uniform mobility control measures taken suggests that multi-seeding could have played an important role in shaping the spreading of the disease. In this work, we focus on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 among the $52$ Spanish provinces, showing that local incidence strongly correlates with mobility occurred in the early-stage weeks from and to Madrid, the main mobility hub and where the initial local outbreak unfolded. These results clarify the higher order effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight the relevance of its control.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mattia Mazzoli","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"David Mateo","author_inst":"Kido Dynamics SA"},{"author_name":"Alberto Hernando","author_inst":"Kido Dynamics SA"},{"author_name":"Sandro Meloni","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Interdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"Jose Javier Ramasco","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica Insterdisciplinar y Sistemas Complejos IFISC (CSIC-UIB)"},{"author_name":"Simon Stanworth","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hal Drakesmith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory & Beijing Key Laboratory for Mechanisms Research and Precision Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases, Peking Union Medical Col"},{"author_name":"Christopher Leveque","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mary R.
