As a consequence of restrictive public health measures like isolation, quarantine, and community containment, the provision of mental health services is a major challenge. Evidence from past virus epidemics and the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak indicate high prevalence rates of mental health problems (MHP) as short- and long-term consequences. However, a broader picture of MHP among different populations is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a rapid review on MHP prevalence rates published since 2000, during and after epidemics, including the general public, health care workers, and survivors. Any quantitative articles reporting on MHP rates were included. Out of 2855 articles screened, a total of 74 were included in this review. Results: Most original studies on MHP were conducted in China in the context of SARS-CoV-1, and reported on anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms\/disorder, general psychiatric morbidity, and psychological symptoms. The MHP rates across studies, populations, and epidemics vary substantially. While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g. distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP. Discussion: MHP vary largely across countries and risk-groups in reviewed studies. The results call attention to potentially high MHP during epidemics. Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simeon J Zuercher Jr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kerksieck Jr.","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Public and Organizational Health, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christine Adamus Jr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"},{"author_name":"Christian Burr Jr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"},{"author_name":"Anja I Lehmann Jr.","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Public and Organizational Health, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Flavia K Huber Jr.","author_inst":"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dirk Richter Sr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20104422","rel_title":"Contributions of Latin American researchers in the understanding the novel coronavirus outbreak: A literature review","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20104422","rel_abs":"This paper aimed to give the visibility of Latin American researchers' contributions to the comprehension of COVID-19; our method was a literature review. Currently, the world is facing a health and socioeconomic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its disease COVID-19. Therefore, in less than four months, researchers have published a significant number of articles related to this novel virus. For instance, a search focused on the Scopus database on April 10, 2020, showed 1224 documents published by authors with 1797 affiliations from 80 countries. 25.4%, 24.0%, and 12.6% of these national affiliations were from China, Europe, and the USA, respectively, making these regions leaders in COVID-19 research. In the case of Latin America, on April 10, 2020, we searched different databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, finding that the contribution of this region was 2.7% of the total publications found. In other words, we found 153 publications related to COVID-19 with at least one Latin American researcher. We summarized and processed the information from these 153 publications, finding active participation in topics like medical, social, and environmental considerations, bioinformatics, and epidemiology.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karen Y Fiesco-Sepulveda","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Surcolombiana, Neiva, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Luis Miguel Serrano-Bermudez","author_inst":"Bioprocesses and Bioprospecting Group, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C., Colombia."},{"author_name":"Christine Adamus Jr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"},{"author_name":"Christian Burr Jr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"},{"author_name":"Anja I Lehmann Jr.","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Public and Organizational Health, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Flavia K Huber Jr.","author_inst":"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dirk Richter Sr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104588","rel_title":"COVID 19: Real-time Forecasts of Confirmed Cases, Active Cases, and Health Infrastructure Requirements for India and its Majorly Affected States using the ARIMA model.","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104588","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease which has been declared a Pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. The Indian public health care system is already overstretched, and this pandemic is making things even worse. That is why forecasting cases for India is necessary to meet the future demands of the health infrastructure caused due to COVID-19. Objective: Our study forecasts the confirmed and active cases for COVID-19 until July mid, using time series Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Additionally, we estimated the number of isolation beds, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and ventilators required for the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We used ARIMA model for forecasting confirmed and active cases till the 15th July. We used time-series data of COVID-19 cases in India from 14th March to 22nd May. We estimated the requirements for ICU beds as 10%, ventilators as 5% and isolation beds as 85% of the active cases forecasted using the ARIMA model. Results: Our forecasts indicate that India will have an estimated 7,47,772 confirmed cases (95% CI: 493943, 1001601) and 296,472 active cases (95% CI:196820, 396125) by 15th July. While Maharashtra will be the most affected state, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases, Punjab is expected to have an estimated 115 active cases by 15th July. India needs to prepare 2,52,001 isolation beds (95% CI: 167297, 336706), 29,647 ICU beds (95% CI: 19682, 39612), and 14,824 ventilator beds (95% CI: 9841, 19806). Conclusion: Our forecasts show an alarming situation for India, and Maharashtra in particular. The actual numbers can go higher than our estimated numbers as India has a limited testing facility and coverage.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rishabh Tyagi","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahadev Bramhankar","author_inst":"International Institute For population Sciences, Mumbai"},{"author_name":"Mohit Pandey","author_inst":"IIPS"},{"author_name":"Kishore M","author_inst":"IIPS"},{"author_name":"Anja I Lehmann Jr.","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Public and Organizational Health, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Flavia K Huber Jr.","author_inst":"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dirk Richter Sr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20099309","rel_title":"Evaluating epidemiological scenarios of isolation and further releases considering protection actions to control transmission of CoViD-19 in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20099309","rel_abs":"Sao Paulo State registered the first case of CoViD-19 on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 on 16 March, and implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on 24 March, which is programmed to end on 1 June. A mathematical model considering young (below 60 years old) and elder (above 60 years) subpopulations was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the new coronavirus in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This deterministic model used the data collected in Sao Paulo State to estimate the model parameters and to evaluate the effects of herd protection, that is, isolation and personal and collective protective measures. Based on the estimated parameters, we evaluated the scenarios of three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed by 14 days between releases, but beginning in three different times (the first release occurring on 1 and 23 June, and 6 July). We concluded that these three strategies of release are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of severe CoViD-19 if social behaviour does not change. However, if protective measures as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) and social distancing could be massively disseminated in the population to decrease the transmission of CoViD-19 by 80%, we concluded that the health care system may not collapse with release.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyun Mo Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computation - UNICAMP"},{"author_name":"Luis Pedro Pedro Lombardi Junior","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"F\u00e1bio Fernandes Morato Castro","author_inst":"Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ariana Campos Yang","author_inst":"Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Estadual de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Anja I Lehmann Jr.","author_inst":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute, Public and Organizational Health, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Flavia K Huber Jr.","author_inst":"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dirk Richter Sr.","author_inst":"Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital for Mental Health (UPD), Bern, Switzerland and University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20099960","rel_title":"Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2: targeting of endothelial cells renders a complex disease with thrombotic microangiopathy and aberrant immune response.

A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking. METHODS Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays. RESULTS Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples. CONCLUSIONS We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release. We discuss the involvement of critical regulatory pathways.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clare Bryce","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount

reported the greatest number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally. Objective: To describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Cohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Setting: 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states. Patients: 2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020. Measurements: Age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. Results: Ninety-two percent of patients had at least 1 underlying condition; 32% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 19% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15% vasopressors; and 17% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race\/ethnicity was not associated with either ICU admission or death. Limitation: Data were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality for COVID-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lindsay Kim","author_inst":"Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA; US Public Health Service, Rockville, MD"},{"author_name":"Shikha Garg","author_inst":"US Public Health Service, Rockville, MD, Influenza Division"},{"author_name":"Alissa O'Halloran","author_inst":"Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Michael Whitaker","author_inst":"Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huong Pham","author_inst":"Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Evan J.

The advent of vaccines has eradicated some of the serious pathogens and reduced many others. However, pandemics are still part of our modern world, as we continue to have pandemics as devastating as HIV and as alarming as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola and the Middle East respiratory syndrome. The Covid-19 epidemic with 0-exponential contamination curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise, nor should it have been the last pandemic in the world. In this article, we try to summarize the lost opportunities as well as the lessons learned, hoping that we can do better in the future. The objective of this study is to relate the situation of Covid-19 in African countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic. It also allows us to verify how, according to the observed situation, the African ecosystem seems to be much more resilient compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is in the thousands. To verify this, the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported for different states of the world are compared to the ages of life and the average annual temperature of these states. The results show that the less dramatic balance of the African continent compared to other continents is partly linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheikh Faye Sr.","author_inst":"Assane Seck University of Ziguinchor"},{"author_name":"CheikhTidiane Wade Sr.","author_inst":"Assane Seck University of Ziguinchor"},{"author_name":"Ibrahima Demba Dione Sr.","author_inst":"Assane Seck University of Ziguinchor"},{"author_name":"Anton Vladzymyrskyy","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Natalya Ledikhova","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow,"},{"author_name":"Victor Gombolevskiy","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Ivan Blokhin","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Pavel Gelezhe","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Anna Gonchar","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Valeria Chernina","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Babkin","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center for Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies of the Moscow H"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Maya L.

In the literature, different forecasting methods have been published attempting to solve the problem. However, a simple and accurate forecasting method is required for its implementation in any part of the world. This paper presents a precise and straightforward forecasting method named SVR-ESAR (Support Vector regression hybridized with the classical Exponential smoothing and ARIMA).

Lack of any vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of COVID-19 patients. Methods We systematically integrated and analyzed published biomedical literature and public social media data to expand our landscape of clinical and demographic variables of COVID-19. Through semantic analysis, 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of COVID-19, and 84,140 tweet posts from 1,036 COVID-19 positive users were collected. In total, 59 symptoms were identified across both datasets. Findings Approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistency across outcomes of COVID-19. From the consensus analysis, we identified clinical and demographic variables that were specific for individual outcomes of COVID-19. Also, 25 novel symptoms that have been not previously well characterized, but were mentioned in social media. Furthermore, we observed that there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together among COVID-19 patients. Interpretation Identified outcome-specific clinical and demographic variables, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify COVID-19 patients and predict their clinical outcomes providing appropriate treatments.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jouhyun Jeon","author_inst":"Klick Inc"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Baruah","author_inst":"Klick Inc"},{"author_name":"Sarah Sarabadani","author_inst":"Klick Inc"},{"author_name":"Adam Palanica","author_inst":"Klick Inc"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ivan Blokhin","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Pavel Gelezhe","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Anna Gonchar","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Valeria Chernina","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center of Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies, Department of Health Care of Moscow"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Babkin","author_inst":"Research and Practical Clinical Center for Diagnostics and Telemedicine Technologies of the Moscow H"},{"author_name":"Sue Kim","author_inst":"Michigan Department of Health and Human Services"},{"author_name":"Maya L.

The mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unacceptably high and new strategies are urgently needed to rapidly identify and treat patients at risk for organ failure. Clinical epidemiologic studies demonstrate that vulnerability to organ failure is greatest after viral clearance from the upper airway, which suggests that dysregulation of the host immune response is a critical mediator of clinical deterioration and death. Autopsy and pre-clinical evidence implicate aberrant complement activation in endothelial injury and organ failure. A potential therapeutic strategy warranting investigation is to inhibit complement, with case reports of successful treatment of COVID-19 with inhibitors of complement. However, this approach requires careful balance between the host protective and potential injurious effects of complement activation, and biomarkers to identify the optimal timing and candidates for therapy are lacking. Here we report the presence of complement activation products on circulating erythrocytes from hospitalized COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. These findings suggest that novel erythrocyte-based diagnostics provide a method to identify patients with dysregulated complement activation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"LK Metthew Lam","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sophie J.

The country had been under a strict lockdown since 20 March 2020, and currently the lockdown is being relaxed gradually. The objective of this paper is to describe a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied to different scenarios after lockout, utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of total government response. Methods COVID-19 Stringency Index (C19SI) is published and updated real time by a research group from Oxford university on 17 selected mitigation and suppression measures employed by different countries. We have mapped and validated the stringency index for Sri Lanka and subsequently validated the projection model in two phases. Predictions for the base-case scenario, less stringent scenarios, advanced relaxation scenarios, and high-risk districts were done with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using the validated model, utilizing data up to 10th May. Results C19SI was able to accommodate all of the government responses. The model using validated C19SI could predict number of cases with 95% confidence for a period of two weeks. The model predicted base-case scenario of 815 (95%CI, 753-877) active cases by 17 May 2020 and 648 (95%CI, 599-696) cases for the high-risk districts by 18 May 2020. The model further predicted 3,159 (95%CI, 2,928-3,391) cases for 75% stringency and 928,824 (95%CI, 861,772-995,877) cases for 50% stringency. Advancing normalcy by three weeks resulted in the case load increasing to 4526 (95%CI, 4309-4744) by 30 June 2020. Conclusion The proposed prediction model based on C19SI provides policy makers an evidence based scientific method for identifying suppression measures that can be relaxed at the most appropriate time.

Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods EMBASE, PubMed\/ Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, Tau2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias. Results: 148 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12149 patients (5739 female) and a median age was 47.0 [35.0-64.6]. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication, while 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic. Older age (SMD: 1.25 [0.78- 1.72]; p < 0.001), being male (RR = 1.32 [1.13-1.54], p = 0.005) and pre-existing comorbidity (RR = 1.69 [1.48-1.94]; p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5-98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Eggers test: p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our meta-analyses revealed important risk factors that are associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine Ruth Jutzeler","author_inst":"Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lucie Bourguignon","author_inst":"Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Caroline V.

Aiming at screening for secondary pneumonia, we collected the data of our first twelve ICU patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Surprisingly, four were detected with Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pj) DNA and RNA, resulting in Pj prevalence of 17%. Pj is a ubiquitous ascomycetes fungus that thrives at the surface of type-I pneumocytes, specifically in human alveoli, leading to pneumocystosis in immunocompromised patients. Interestingly, none of our patients was immunocompromised per se before admission, while all presented the recognized risk factors for life-threatening COVID-19 infection. Observing such high prevalence in COVID-infected patients was unexpected. Almost all patients developed ARDS and received high-dose steroids to prevent worsening, as suggested by reports from China. In Pj-positive patients requiring steroids, prophylaxis was given to avoid the risk of pneumocystosis and increased lung inflammation that may compromise the outcome. We are strongly convinced that testing deep lung specimens for Pj in severe COVID-19 patients should be recommended and Pj-positive patients treated with steroids, and given anti-Pj prophylaxis. This message is important, given the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients in the ICU.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre Alanio","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Voicu","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"sarah Delliere","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Bruno Megarbane","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Stephane Bretagne","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Bastian Rieck","author_inst":"Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital Basel, University Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin-Sutter","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases & Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Bacteriology & Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Karsten Borgwardt","author_inst":"Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias Walter","author_inst":"Swiss Paraplegic Center"},{"author_name":"Douglas B.

Controversy surrounds the circulating cytokine\/chemokine profile of COVID19-associated ARDS, with some groups suggesting that it is similar to non-COVID19 ARDS patients and others observing substantial differences. Moreover, while a hyperinflammatory phenotype associates with higher mortality in non-COVID19 ARDS, there is little information on the inflammatory landscape association with mortality in COVID19 ARDS patients. Even though the circulating leukocytes transcriptomic signature has been associated with distinct phenotypes and outcomes in critical illness including ARDS, it is unclear whether the mortality-associated inflammatory mediators from COVID19 patients are transcriptionally regulated in the leukocyte compartment. Here, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 41 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID19 infection using highly calibrated methods to define the levels of plasma cytokines\/chemokines and their gene expressions in circulating leukocytes. Plasma IL1RA and IL8 were found positively associated with mortality while RANTES and EGF negatively associated with that outcome. However, the leukocyte gene expression of these proteins had no statistically significant correlation with mortality. These data suggest a unique inflammatory signature associated with severe COVID19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Balnis","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alejandro P Adam","author_inst":"Albany Medical College"},{"author_name":"Amit Chopra","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hau C Chieng","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul J Feustel","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Katherine A Overmyer","author_inst":"Morgridge Institute for Research, Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Evgenia Shishkova","author_inst":"Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Joshua J Coon","author_inst":"Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Morgridge Institute for Research; Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Harold A Singer","author_inst":"Albany Medical College"},{"author_name":"Marc A Judson","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ariel Jaitovich","author_inst":"Albany Medical College"},{"author_name":"Douglas B.

In consequence, there is an inflection point of maximum curvature in the screening curve defined as a function of the sensitivity and specificity beyond which the rate of change of a test's PPV declines sharply relative to disease prevalence. Herein, we demonstrate a mathematical model exploring this phenomenon and define the prevalence threshold point where this change occurs. Understanding where this prevalence point lies in the curve has important implications for the interpretation of test results, the administration of healthcare systems, the implementation of public health measures, and in cases of pandemics like SARS-CoV-2, the functioning of society at large. To illustrate the methods herein described, we provide the example of the screening strategies used in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, and calculate the prevalence threshold statistic of different tests available today. This concept can help contextualize the validity of a screening test in real time, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacques Balayla","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ariane Lasry","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Yaron Gil","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Volodarsky-Perel","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Paul J Feustel","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Katherine A Overmyer","author_inst":"Morgridge Institute for Research, Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Evgenia Shishkova","author_inst":"Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Joshua J Coon","author_inst":"Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Morgridge Institute for Research; Madison, WI"},{"author_name":"Harold A Singer","author_inst":"Albany Medical College"},{"author_name":"Marc A Judson","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ariel Jaitovich","author_inst":"Albany Medical College"},{"author_name":"Douglas B.

OBJECTIVE: to investigate the correspondences between the structure of the mobility network and the emergence of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian cities. METHODS: we adopt the data from the Brazilian Health Ministry and the terrestrial flow of people between cities from the IBGE database in two scales: Brazilian cities without the North region and cities from the Sao Paulo state. Grounded on the complex networks approach, cities are represented as nodes and the flows as edges. Network centrality measures such as strength and degree are ranked and compared to the list of Brazilian cities, ordered according to the day that they confirmed the first case of COVID-19. FINDINGS: The strength presents the best correspondences and the interiorization process of SARS-CoV-2 is captured in the Sao Paulo state when different thresholds are applied to the network flows. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: the strength captures the cities with a higher vulnerability of receiving new cases of COVID-19. Some countryside cities such as Feira de Santana (Bahia state), Ribeirao Preto (Sao Paulo state), and Caruaru (Pernambuco state) have strength comparable to states' capitals, making them potential super spreaders.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vander L.

These symptoms and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with both the - and {beta}-chains variable domains complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y\/N\/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.\n\nSignificanceAlthough children have been largely spared from severe COVID-19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States, termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mary Hongying Cheng","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"She Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Rebecca A.

SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike\/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike\/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction. Additionally, we demonstrate that a proportion of Spike can simultaneously interact with multiple ACE2 dimers, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an ACE2-accessible \"up\" conformation. Our findings have significant implications on the design strategies of therapeutic molecules that block the Spike\/ACE2 interaction. The constructs we describe are freely available to the research community as molecular tools to further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irene Lui","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Xin X Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Shion A Lim","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Susanna Elledge","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Paige Solomon","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Rettko","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Beth Shoshana Zha","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lisa L Kirkemo","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Josef A Gramespacher","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Julio Cesar Cetrulo Lorenzi","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Davide F Robbiani","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michel C Nussenzweig","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Oren Rosenberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Leung","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James A.

Due to this extremely recent association with humans, SARS-CoV-2 may not yet be fully adapted to its human host. This has led to speculations that some lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving towards higher transmissibility. The most plausible candidate mutations under putative natural selection are those which have emerged repeatedly and independently (homoplasies). Here, we formally test whether any of the recurrent mutations that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2 are significantly associated with increased viral transmission. To do so, we develop a phylogenetic index to quantify the relative number of descendants in sister clades with and without a specific allele. We apply this index to a carefully curated set of recurrent mutations identified within a dataset of 46,723 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients worldwide. We do not identify a single recurrent mutation in this set convincingly associated with increased viral transmission. Instead, recurrent SARS-CoV-2 mutations currently in circulation appear to be evolutionary neutral. Recurrent mutations also seem primarily induced by the human immune system via host RNA editing, rather than being signatures of adaptation to the novel human host. In conclusion, we find no evidence at this stage for the emergence of significantly more transmissible lineages of SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent mutations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy van Dorp","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Damien Richard","author_inst":"Cirad"},{"author_name":"Cedric CS Tan","author_inst":"UCL Genetics Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK"},{"author_name":"Liam P.

Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Here, we devised a model that estimates the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions regarding age, gender, presence of prior medical conditions, general feeling, and the symptoms fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and loss of taste or smell, all of which have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel over the past 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. We successfully validated the model on held-out individuals from Israel where it achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46.3% at a 10% sensitivity and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel by further validating it on an independently collected symptom survey dataset from the U.K., U.S. and Sweden, where it achieved a PPV of 34.7% at 10% sensitivity. Moreover, evaluating the model's performance on this latter independent dataset on entries collected one week prior to the PCR test and up to the day of the test we found the highest performance on the day of the test. As our tool can be used online and without the need of exposure to suspected patients, it may have worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified and isolated.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saar Shoer","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tal Karady","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Gavrieli","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tomer Meir","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amit Lavon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Kolobkov","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Gayle E.

Utilizing this algorithm, our paper also suggests a ventilator ordering and returning policy. The policy will dictate at the end of each day how many ventilators should be ordered tonight from a central stockpile so that they will arrive by tomorrow morning and how many ventilators should be returned tomorrow morning to the central stockpile.

We predict symptoms' incidence using binomial models for spatially discrete data, and we introduce these as a covariate in the spatial analysis of COVID-19 incidence, as reported by the Belgian government during the days following a survey round. The symptoms' incidence predictions explain a significant proportion of the variation in the relative risks based on the confirmed cases, and exceedance probability maps of the symptoms' incidence and the confirmed cases' relative risks pinpoint the same high-risk region.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. Methods To find out the risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence, a negative binomial design was applied to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Results 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P<0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median and high prevalence counties . The segregation between non-Whites and Whites and higher Hispanic population had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. Conclusions The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race\/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may lead to the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Tian","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liyuan Hu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yukang Jiang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Congyuan Duan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhongfei Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xueqin Wang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Philippe Beutels","author_inst":"University of Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Iris Kalka","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Anastasia Godneva","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ori Cohen","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Adam Kariv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Ori Hoch","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Mushon Zer-Aviv","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Noam Castel","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Carole Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Angela Irony","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Geiger","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Dorit Hizi","author_inst":"The public knowledge workshop"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Database Research Unit, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Gayle E.

Objective: To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with Covid-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously linked to stroke. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Setting: Two academic hospitals in New York City. Participants: We included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 from March 4, 2020 through May 2, 2020. Our comparison cohort included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A or B from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018 (calendar years spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). Exposures: Covid-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction, and laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B. Main Outcomes and Measures: A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, etiological mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of Covid-19 patients with ischemic stroke versus the proportion among patients with influenza. Results: Among 2,132 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19, 31 patients (1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0%-2.1%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78) and 58% were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 (26%) cases. For our comparison cohort, we identified 1,516 patients with influenza, of whom 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was significantly higher with Covid-19 than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.3-24.9). Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 1.5% of patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with Covid-19 experienced ischemic stroke, a rate 7.5-fold higher than in patients with influenza. Future studies should investigate the thrombotic mechanisms in Covid-19 in order to determine optimal strategies to prevent disabling complications like ischemic stroke.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander E.

The COVID-19 triggered partial and full lockdown across the globe in an effort to prevent its spread. COVID-19 causes serious fatalities with United States of America recording over 3,000 deaths within 24 hours, the highest in the world for a single day. In this paper, we propose a framework integrated with machine learning to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in smart cities. A novel mathematical model is created to show the spread of the COVID-19 in smart cities. The proposed solution framework can generate, capture, store and analyze data using machine learning algorithms to detect, prevent the spread of COVID-19, forecast next epidemic, effective contact tracing, diagnose cases, monitor COVID-19 patient, COVID-19 vaccine development, track potential COVID-19 patients, aid in COVID-19 drug discovery and provide better understanding of the virus in smart cities. The study outlined case studies on the application of machine learning to help in the fight against COVID-19 in hospitals in smart cities across the world. The framework can provide a guide for real world execution in smart cities. The proposed framework has the potential for helping national healthcare systems in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic in smart cities.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibrahim Abaker Targio Hashem","author_inst":"Future Technology Research Center, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Absalom E Ezugwu","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.

In case of COVID-19 this spreading behaviour is quantitatively better described with a mobility-driven SIR-SEIR model [2] rather than the homogenous mixing models. Lockdown has dramatically slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in UK, and even more significantly, has changed the growth in the total number of infected from exponential to quadratic. This significant change is due to a transition from a mobility-driven epidemic spreading to a spatial epidemic which is dominated by slow growth of spatially isolated clusters of infected population. Our results strongly indicate that, to avoid a return to exponential growth of COVID-19 (also known as second wave), mobility restrictions should not be prematurely lifted. Instead mobility should be kept restricted while new measures, such as wearing of masks and contact tracing, get implemented in order to prevent health services becoming overwhelmed due to a resurgence of exponential growth.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maziar Nekovee","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Felix Mairanowski","author_inst":"Husmann"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.
