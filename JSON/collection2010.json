However, there is a lack of regarding comprehensive stroke phenotype and characteristics Methods: We conducted a multinational observational study on features of consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (CVST) among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We further investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countrie's health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO; 10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria. We observed a lower median NIHSS (8[3-17], versus 11[5-17]; p=0.02) and higher rate of mechanical thrombectomy (12.4% versus 2%; p<0.001) in countries with middle to high-health expenditure when compared to countries with lower health expenditure. The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relatively large group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent among a relatively large cohort of patients. Among hospitalized patients, the stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanical thrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","rel_num_authors":113,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shima Shahjouei","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Georgios Tsivgoulis","author_inst":"Second Department of Neurology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Attikon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Eric Koza","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ashkhan Mowla","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Alireza Vafaei Sadr","author_inst":"Department de Physique Theorique and Center for Astroparticle Physics, University Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Arash Kia","author_inst":"Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Tehran University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Stefania Mondello","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Achille Cernigliaro","author_inst":"Regional Health Authority of Sicily"},{"author_name":"Annemarei Ranta","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Punter","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Faezeh Khodadadi","author_inst":"PES university,bengalore,India"},{"author_name":"Mrina Sabra","author_inst":"Lebanese University\/Medical School, NRC (Neurosciences Research Center)"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

This created the need for alternate workflows with limited reliance on specialised reagents, equipment and staff. We present here the validation and implementation of such a workflow for preparing samples for downstream SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using liquid handling robots. The rapid sample preparation technique evaluated, which included sample centrifugation and heating prior to RT-PCR, showed a 97.37% (95% CI: 92.55-99.28%) positive percent agreement and 97.30% (95% CI: 90.67-99.52%) negative percent agreement compared to nucleic acid purification-based testing. This method was subsequently adopted as the primary sample preparation method in the Groote Schuur Hospital Virology Diagnostic Laboratory in Cape Town, South Africa.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gert Johannes Kruger Marais","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Michelle Naidoo","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Nei-yuan Hsiao","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Ziyaad Valley-Omar","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Heidi Smuts","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Diana Ruth Hardie","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Arash Kia","author_inst":"Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Tehran University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Stefania Mondello","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, University of Messina"},{"author_name":"Achille Cernigliaro","author_inst":"Regional Health Authority of Sicily"},{"author_name":"Annemarei Ranta","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin Punter","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Wellington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Faezeh Khodadadi","author_inst":"PES university,bengalore,India"},{"author_name":"Mrina Sabra","author_inst":"Lebanese University\/Medical School, NRC (Neurosciences Research Center)"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about four-fold from one to four months post-symptom onset. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau.

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruichen He","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Linyue Gao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Trifonov","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Hong","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Naomi Wilcox","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Logue","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kiel Shuey","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda M Casto","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

The exponent {lambda} of the exponential function expressing the number of newly tested positive persons was defined as an linear equation explicitly with three important parameters, transmission coefficient, social distancing ratio x and isolation rate q. In this study, applying this model to the number of positive persons in publicly available database, daily {lambda} values are regression analyzed, and social distancing ratio and isolation rate are derived. Analyses for 7 countries including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and western countries are performed and determine the dynamic locus of q-x relation on the q-x plane during epidemic propagation. Finally, the remaining parameter, the transmission coefficient is shown to closely relate to the maximum {lambda}, {lambda}max, and {lambda}max (transmission coefficient) is characterized as a specific value for each country. Then, the magnitude of {lambda}max is combined with the value of {lambda}min to influence the total number of new cases until the convergence stage.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koichi Hashiguchi","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Linyue Gao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Trifonov","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Hong","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Naomi Wilcox","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Logue","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kiel Shuey","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Amanda M Casto","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deleah Pettie","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Ramezani","author_inst":"Neurology Department,Shahid Beheshti University of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Oluwaseyi Olulana","author_inst":"Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Durgesh Chaudhary","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Aicha Lyoubi","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France"},{"author_name":"Bruce Campbell","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital Department of Neurology and University of Melbourne."},{"author_name":"Juan F Arenillas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Bock","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Klinikum Frankfurt Hochst, Frankfurt Germany"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralization test, and a neutralization assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results: From baseline to week six, n=1,080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from n=217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4 % in week six, p<0.001). In sera of convalescent PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from ELISAs using e.g. the S1 spike protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralization. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the six week study period. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralization against live SARS CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Metodi V Stankov","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bianca Schulte","author_inst":"University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University Bonn"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Willenzon","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lena Boeck","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anh Thu Tran","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thea Thiele","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Theresa Graalmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Aims: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on the national health insurance data. Each patient with a mental or behavioral disorder (diagnosed during six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index with up to four patients without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk and risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 230,565 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33,653 (14.6%) had mental disorders, 928\/33,653 (2.76%) tested positive, and 56\/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariate analysis with the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.12); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81). Among confirmed cases, mortality risk significantly increased in patients with mental disorders (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.07-3.15). Conclusion: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors of mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk did not increase in overall mental disorders, patients with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to the infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ha-Lim Jeon","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Soo Kwon","author_inst":"Seoul National University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"So-Hee Park","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"University Bonn"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Willenzon","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anna-Lena Boeck","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anh Thu Tran","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thea Thiele","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Theresa Graalmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus. Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works. Methods To investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets. Findings The transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region. Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus. Interpretation An onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet. The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence.

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 821 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (237) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (584). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. Results: Decedents were more likely to be male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) than the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (89% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and may serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew F.

It is known that wearing PPE, and specifically face masks, has physcial consequences like headache and pain, which can increase stress among nursing staff. However, none of these studies placed a focus on PPE and nursing staff, although nurses are the only members of the health care profession who are at the patients bedsides 24\/7, and PPE is the only way to protect them from a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between the use of PPE and stress among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted, which we distributed using snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of (inter-)national recommendations as well as the international literature. We used the perceived level of stress scale to measure the nursing staff members stress levels. Results We included data collected from 2600 nurses in this analysis. Nearly all nursing staff wore face masks. We showed that more than two-thirds of the nurses had moderate to high levels of stress. No statistically significant association between the use of PPE and stress was detected. However, we show a statistically significant association between the duration of mask usage and stress. Discussion and conclusions Nearly all participating nurses wore face masks or FFP masks to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This observation might indicate that Austrian nurses display a high level of compliance with national and international regulations and play a key role in such pandemics. Our results also show that increased mask-wearing time led to increased stress levels. These results suggest that (inter-)national regulations on how and when to use PPE should include a maximum duration of time for wearing each type of mask.

Usually detection of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR method, but it must be long time that RNA is treated by extraction, concentration and purification, and detected by RT-PCR method. We modified various methods, of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough. In one point of the evaluations, real-time RT-PCR could be finished in very short time with using mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100 (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.). It was able to detect positive control RNA for 20 minutes by each method according to the National Institute of Infections Disease in Japan (NIID), and less than 13.5 minutes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in USA (CDC). In another point of the evaluations, surprisingly, Human coronavirus 229E, which was substituted for SARS-CoV-2, could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of RNA. As that was, it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct RT-PCR. Therefore, it might eliminate wasteful time, avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination. In light of the above two points, SARS-CoV-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply. With using this mobile real-time PCR, these methods should be suitable for not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masaaki Muraoka","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Yukiko Tanoi","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Tetsutaro Tada","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"MIkio Mizukoshi","author_inst":"Certified Non-Profit Organization Biomedical Science Association, Japan"},{"author_name":"Osamu Kawaguchi","author_inst":"Business Innovation Center, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd., Japan"},{"author_name":"Sascha Ott","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Paul G Murray","author_inst":"University of Birmingham and University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Eslam Al-abadi","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dawson","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Jyothish","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Hari Krishnan Kanthimathinathan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Monaghan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens hospital NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Prasad Nagakumar","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Barnaby R Scholefield","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Kearns","author_inst":"NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Graham Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

To understand the genetic link between aging and the risk of COVID-19, we conducted a multi-instrument Mendelian randomization analysis and found that the genetic variation that leads to a longer lifespan is significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio is 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.57; P = 1.3 x 10-4) per additional 10 years of life, and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.77; P = 7.2 x 10-6) per unit higher log odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. On the other hand, there was no association between COVID-19 susceptibility and healthspan (the lifespan free of the top seven age-related morbidities). To examine the relationship at the phenotypic level, we applied various biological aging clock models and detected an association between the biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection for all subjects as well as for the individuals free of chronic disease. Biological age acceleration was also significantly associated with the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest a causal relationship between aging and COVID-19, defined by genetic variance, the rate of aging, and the burden of chronic diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kejun Ying","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ranran Zhai","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Timothy V Pyrkov","author_inst":"Gero LLC PTE"},{"author_name":"Marco Mariotti","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Peter O Fedichev","author_inst":"Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xia Shen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, University of Edinburgh, Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eslam Al-abadi","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashish Chikermane","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Dawson","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Scott Hackett","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Jyothish","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Hari Krishnan Kanthimathinathan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Sean Monaghan","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens hospital NHS foundation trust"},{"author_name":"Prasad Nagakumar","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Barnaby R Scholefield","author_inst":"Birmingham Womens and Childrens NHS foundation trust and University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steven Welch","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pamela Kearns","author_inst":"NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Graham Taylor","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Diana Ernst","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Jablonka","author_inst":"Hannover Medical  School"},{"author_name":"Christine Happle","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Joan Montaner","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain"},{"author_name":"Saeideh Aghayari Sheikh Neshin","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Poursina Hospital"},{"author_name":"Diana Aguiar de Sousa","author_inst":"Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Their thorough validation is of extreme importance before using them as epidemiological tools to infer population seroprevalence, and as complementary diagnostic tools to molecular approaches (e.g. RT-qPCR). Here we assayed commercial serological tests (semiquantitative and qualitative) from 11 suppliers in 126 samples collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and from 36 healthy and HIV-infected individuals (collected at the pre-COVID-19 pandemic). Specificity was above 95% in 9 tests. Samples from COVID-19 patients were stratified by days since symptoms onset (<10, 10-15, 16-21 and >21 days). Tests sensitivity increases with time since symptoms onset, and peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum: 91.2%); and from 16-21 to >21 days for IgG, depending on the test (maximum: 94.1%). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with severe clinical presentation have lower relative levels of IgM, IgA and IgG at <10 days since symptoms onset in comparison to patients with non-severe presentation. At >21 days since symptoms onset the relative levels of IgM and IgG (in one test) are significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation, suggesting a delay in the upsurge of Ig against SARS-CoV-2 in those patients. This study highlights the high specificity of most of the evaluated tests, and sensitivity heterogeneity. Considering the virus genetic evolution and population immune response to it, continuous monitoring of commercially available serological tests towards SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Serre-Miranda","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

We evaluated the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in prepandemic sample cohorts across five sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Methods: Specificity of the immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual serum and\/or plasma samples from blood donors or routine diagnostic testing. All samples were collected before September 2019 and therefore presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cohorts included samples from blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric patients. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Overall specificities for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 9575 samples from blood donors (n = 6714) and diagnostic specimens (n = 2861) were 99.82% (95% CI 99.69-99.91) and 99.93% (95% CI 99.75-99.99), respectively. Among 2256 samples from pregnant women, specificity was 99.91% (95% CI 99.68-99.99). Among 205 paediatric samples, specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.22-100). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a very high specificity across blood donor samples and diagnostic specimens from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Our findings support the use of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a potential tool for determination of an immune response following previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the general population, including in blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric populations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Riester","author_inst":"Labor Augsburg MVZ GmbH, Augsburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beda Krieter","author_inst":"Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service West GmbH, Central Laboratory Hagen, Hagen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Peter Findeisen","author_inst":"MVZ Labor Limbach, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Laimighofer","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Schoenfeld","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tina Laengin","author_inst":"Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregionale Blood Transfusion Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland; Institute for Infectious Diseases (IFIK), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pedro Alves-Peixoto","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than one day congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel B Reeves","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"E.

The development of accessible and practical approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the college population is paramount for deploying recurrent surveillance testing as an essential strategy for virus detection, containment, and mitigation. Objectives: In this study, we set out to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects in a university community, using, for the first time, CREST, a CRISPR-Cas13-based test that we developed for accessible and large scale viral surveillance1. Study Design, Setting, and Participants: We enrolled 1,808 asymptomatic persons to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing. We compared viral prevalence in self-collected oropharyngeal swab samples obtained in two time periods: May 28th-June 11th and June 23rd-July 2nd, 2020. We detected viral genomes in these samples using CREST, and we corroborated our results with a point-of-reference RT-qPCR test. Positive samples were confirmed by a clinical laboratory and reported to the local Public Health Department. Results: All the 732 tests performed between late May to early June were negative. In contrast, tests performed on 1,076 samples collected between late June to early July revealed eight positive cases by CREST, confirmed by RT-qPCR and CLIA-diagnostic testing. The average age of the positive cases was 21.7 years; all individuals self-identified as students. These metrics showed that CREST was effective at capturing positive SARS-CoV-2 cases in our student population. Notably, the viral loads detected in these asymptomatic cases resemble those seen in clinical samples, highlighting the potential of covert viral transmission. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study revealed a substantial shift in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in a young and asymptomatic population, and uncovered the leading wave of a local outbreak that coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. Moreover, and most notably, the almost perfect concordance between CRISPR- and PCR-based testing indicated that CREST using self-collected OP swabs is reliable and it allows expanding options for large-scale surveillance testing and detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as is required to resume operations in higher education institutions in the US and abroad.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer N Rauch","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Eric Valois","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Jose Carlos Ponce-Rojas","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Zach Aralis","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan L Lach","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Francesca Zappa","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Morgane Audouard","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Sabrina C Solley","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Chinmay Vaidya","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Michael Costello","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology"},{"author_name":"Holly Smith","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Ali Javanbakht","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Betsy Malear","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Laura Polito","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Stewart Comer","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara,"},{"author_name":"Katherine Arn","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Kosik","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Diego Acosta-Alvear","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Z Wilson","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Lynn Fitzgibbons","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arias","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology, Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Margarida Correia-Neves","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and two other patients (4%) were only positive in one of the six serological assays employed. For the remainder, antibody response against the S-protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as highly neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ramona Businger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Karina Althaus","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Simon Fink","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Felix Ruoff","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Klaus Hamprecht","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Virology and Epidemiology of Viral Diseases, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Bertram Flehmig","author_inst":"Mediagnost GmbH, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Tamam Bakchoul","author_inst":"Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Markus F Templin","author_inst":"NMI, Reutlingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Holly Smith","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Ali Javanbakht","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Betsy Malear","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Laura Polito","author_inst":"Student Health Service, University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Stewart Comer","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital; Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories, Santa Barbara,"},{"author_name":"Katherine Arn","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Kosik","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Diego Acosta-Alvear","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Z Wilson","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology; Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Lynn Fitzgibbons","author_inst":"Department of Medical Education and Division of Infectious Diseases, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arias","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental  Biology, Neuroscience Research Institute, University of California"},{"author_name":"Margarida Correia-Neves","author_inst":"Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

In this paper, we have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance in comparison with four commercial ELISAs, EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP COVID-19 IgM\/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were compared using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%\/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%\/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%\/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%\/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%\/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%\/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%\/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%\/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%\/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of positive signals from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, positivity varied with assay repetition. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with analyte prior to performing the assay). In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by analyte spiking. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of false positivity in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the analyte, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Rikhtegaran Tehrani","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Saman Saadat","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebtehal Saleh","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Niel Constantine","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Madicine"},{"author_name":"Anthony L.

We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Schultz","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Harriet J Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission. Methods We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome. Results A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66.8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2\/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 (75.0-140.6) mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5 [1.1-2.1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1.3 [1.2-1.4]), severe ARDS (aOR 3.1 [2.0-4.8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1.4 [1.0-1.9]), and CRRT (aOR 2.2 [1.6-3.0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. Conclusions Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle S Chew","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrik Blixt","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Ahman","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lars Engerstrom","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Vrinnevi Hospital, Norrkoping, Department of Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping"},{"author_name":"Henrik Andersson","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Linkoping University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ritva Kiiski Berggren","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesia, Intensive Care and Perioperative Services, Umea University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anders Tegnell","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Reporting, Public Health Agency of Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sarah McIntyre","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Linkoping University"},{"author_name":"Seb Bacon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Harriet J Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear. Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys. We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies. Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children <10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases; 95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813; 95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030; 95% CI: 3,118, 11,676). School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1), and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening. The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level. A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools. Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening. Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer R Head","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kristin Andrejko","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Qu Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Philip A Collender","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sophie Phillips","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anna Boser","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Alexandra K Heaney","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Hoover","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sean L Wu","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Graham R Northrup","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Karen Click","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Robert Harrison","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Lewnard","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Justin V Remais","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Harriet J Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting UK Biobank population. Participants 421,048 participants who were recruited in England and alive by January 31st 2020, i.e., the start of COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. 50,815 individuals with psychiatric disorders recorded in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak were included in the exposed group, while 370,233 participants without such conditions were in the unexposed group. Measurements We obtained information on positive results of COVID-19 test as registered in the Public Health England, COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data, and COIVD-19 related deaths from the death registers. We also identified individuals who was hospitalized for infections other than COVID-19 during the follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for multiple confounders. Results The mean age at outbreak was 67.8 years and around 43% of the study participants were male. We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, compared with those without such diagnoses. The fully adjusted ORs were 1.44 (95%CI 1.27 to 1.64), 1.67 (1.42 to 1.98), and 2.03 (1.56 to 2.63) for any COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, COVID-19 related death, respectively. The excess risk was observed across all levels of somatic comorbidities and subtypes of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, while further increased with greater number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and increased risk of hospitalization for other infections (1.85 [1.65 to 2.07]). Conclusions Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of COVID-19, especially severe and fatal COVID-19. The similar association observed for hospitalization for other infections suggests a shared pathway between psychiatric disorders and different infections, including altered immune responses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huazhen Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yao Hu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yilong Chen","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Zeng","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yajing Sun","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiye Ying","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Junhui He","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Qu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Donghao Lu","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Fang Fang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Unnur A Valdimarsd\u00f3ttir","author_inst":"University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Huan Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Justin V Remais","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Williamson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Harriet J Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mattew Tenser","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal."},{"author_name":"Mercedes De Lera Alfonso","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Orkhan Alizada","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Elsa Azevedo","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal; Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal."},{"author_name":"Nitin Goyal","author_inst":"Neurology Department, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Tennessee, USA"},{"author_name":"Zabihollah Babaeepour","author_inst":"Neurology ward, Valiasr Hospital, Borujen, Iran"},{"author_name":"Gelareh Banihashemi","author_inst":"Sina hospital (Neurology departement)"},{"author_name":"Leo H Bonati","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak,Iran"},{"author_name":"Carlo Cereda","author_inst":"Stroke Center, Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Lugano, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jason J Chang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Marry Washington Healthcare, Fredricksburg, Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Miljenko Crnjakovic","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Department of Neurology, Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"GianMarco De Marchis","author_inst":"Neurorehabilitation Unit, University Center for Medicine of Aging and Rehabilitation Basel, Felix Platter Hospital, University of Basel, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Massimo del Sette","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Seyed Amir Ebrahimadeh","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Farhoudi","author_inst":"Neurosciences Research Center (NSRC), Tabriz University of Medical Sciences,Tabriz, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ilaria Gandoglia","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Galliera Hospital, Genova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Bruno Goncalves","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, GHU Paris Psychiatrie et Neurosciences, Universite de Paris, INSERM U1266, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Christoph Griessenauer","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehmet Murat Hanci","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty"},{"author_name":"Aristeidis H.

Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the model's parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemic's local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the model's inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the model's inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19's spread.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luyang Liu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Sharad Vikram","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Junpeng Lao","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Alexander D'Amour","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Mark Sandler","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Rif A.

Methods: From April 23rd to May 8th 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swab for direct detection through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and blood for antibodies detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Around 22.1% (n=212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) in the police, and 38.7% (n=370) in the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR at the time of recruitment and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n=15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%. Conclusion: The prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lom&eacute was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government. Therefore, we recommend targeted screening.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wemboo Afiwa Halatoko","author_inst":"Institut National d'Hygiene, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Yao Rodion KONU","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Fifonsi Adjidossi Gbeasor-Komlanvi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Arnold Junior Sadio","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Martin Kouame Tchankoni","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Koffi Segbeaya Komlanvi","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mounerou Salou","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ameyo Monique Dorkenoo","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Issaka Maman","author_inst":"Institut National d'Hygiene (INH), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ametepe Agbobli","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Majeste Ihou Wateba","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Komi Seraphin Adjoh","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Edem Goeh Akue","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Yem-bla Kao","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Innocent Kpeto","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Paul Pana","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kinde-Sossou","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Agbeko Tamakloe","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Josee Nayo-Apetsianyi","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Simon-Pierre Hamadi Assane","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mireille Prince-David","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Sossinou Marcel Awoussi","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mohaman Djibril","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Mijiyawa","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Anoumou Claver Dagnra","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Didier Koumavi Ekouevi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

The secondary aim was to quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Methods: Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Data from the 2014-2018 and 2018 American Community Surveys were used. The simulated prevalence was 0.5% and 1.0% for active and past COVID-19, respectively. Bayesian models, informed by published validity estimates, were used to account for misclassification error when estimating the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Results: Failure to account for misclassification error overestimated the simulated prevalence for active and past COVID-19. Adjustment for misclassification error decreased the point estimate for active and past COVID-10 prevalence by 55% and 29%, respectively. Adjustment for sampling method and misclassification error only captured the simulated past COVID-19 prevalence. The simulated active COVID-19 prevalence was only captured when set to 0.7% and above. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data increased the estimated average daily cases by 8%. Conclusions: Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 is needed but must be accompanied by adjustment for misclassification error to avoid over- or underestimating the prevalence. This approach bolsters disease control efforts. Implementing random testing for active COVID-19 may be best in a smaller geographic area with highly prevalent cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ida Sahlu","author_inst":"MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Alexander B Whittaker","author_inst":"MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Fifonsi Adjidossi Gbeasor-Komlanvi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Arnold Junior Sadio","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Martin Kouame Tchankoni","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Koffi Segbeaya Komlanvi","author_inst":"Centre Africain de Recherche en Epidemiologie et en Sante Publique (CARESP), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mounerou Salou","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ameyo Monique Dorkenoo","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Issaka Maman","author_inst":"Institut National d'Hygiene (INH), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ametepe Agbobli","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Majeste Ihou Wateba","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Komi Seraphin Adjoh","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Edem Goeh Akue","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Faculte des Sciences de la Sante, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Yem-bla Kao","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Innocent Kpeto","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Paul Pana","author_inst":"Conseil Scientifique pour la Riposte contre la pandemie de Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kinde-Sossou","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Agbeko Tamakloe","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Josee Nayo-Apetsianyi","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Simon-Pierre Hamadi Assane","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mireille Prince-David","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Sossinou Marcel Awoussi","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mohaman Djibril","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Mijiyawa","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Anoumou Claver Dagnra","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Didier Koumavi Ekouevi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Design: Nationwide population-based seroepidemiological study combined with two national surveillance systems. Setting and participants: Non-institutionalized Spanish population of all ages. Main outcome measures: The range of IFR was calculated as the observed number of COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths divided by the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the non-institutionalized Spanish population. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all-cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo) up to July 15, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61,092 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide serosurvey between April 27 and June 22, 2020. Results: The overall IFR (95% confidence interval) was 0.8% (0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The IFR ranged between 1.1% (1.0% to 1.2%) and 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and between 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) and 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) and 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men [&ge;]80 years and between 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) and 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women [&ge;]80 years. Conclusion: The sharp increase in SARS-CoV-2 IFR after age 50 was more marked in men than in women. Fatality from COVID-19 is substantially greater than that reported for other common respiratory diseases such as seasonal influenza.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Pastor-Barriuso","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Perez-Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Hernan","author_inst":"Chan School of Public Health, Harvard"},{"author_name":"Mayte Perez-Olmeda","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Raquel Yotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jesus Oteo","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Sanmartin","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Inmaculada Leon-Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Aurora Fernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez-Navarro","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Israel Cruz","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Mariano Martin","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Concepcion Delgado-Sanz","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Nerea Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Jose Leon Paniagua","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Juan Fernando Munoz-Montalvo","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Faustino Blanco","author_inst":"Ministerio de Sanidad"},{"author_name":"Amparo Larrauri","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marina Pollan","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marina Pollan","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Mireille Prince-David","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Sossinou Marcel Awoussi","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Mohaman Djibril","author_inst":"Coordination Nationale de Gestion de la Riposte contre la Covid-19, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Moustafa Mijiyawa","author_inst":"Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Anoumou Claver Dagnra","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et d'Immunologie (BIOLIM), Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Didier Koumavi Ekouevi","author_inst":"Universite de Lome, Departement de Sante Publique, Lome, Togo"},{"author_name":"Ana Aires","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Sao Joao Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal;

Methods: In this retrospective analysis, 24 of 1342(1.8%) patients with COVID-19, presenting with GI bleeding from 22ndApril to 22ndJuly 2020, were included. Results: The mean age of patients was 45.8+\/-12.7 years; 17(70.8%) were males; upper GI(UGI) bleeding: lower GI(LGI) 23:1. Twenty-two(91.6%) patients had evidence of cirrhosis- 21 presented with UGI bleeding while one had bleeding from hemorrhoids. Two patients without cirrhosis were presumed to have non-variceal bleeding. The medical therapy for UGI bleeding included vasoconstrictors- somatostatin in 17(73.9%) and terlipressin in 4(17.4%) patients. All patients with UGI bleeding received proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. Packed red blood cells(PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma and platelets were transfused in 14(60.9%), 3(13.0%) and 3(13.0%), respectively. The median PRBCs transfused was 1(0-3) unit(s). The initial control of UGI bleeding was achieved in all 23 patients and none required an emergency endoscopy. At 5-day follow-up, none rebled or died. Two patients later rebled, one had intermittent bleed due to gastric antral vascular ectasia, while another had rebleed 19 days after discharge. Three(12.5%) cirrhosis patients succumbed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during hospital stay.
