With >8.8 million cases and >450,000 deaths reported globally, a vaccine is urgently needed. We report the available safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose escalation study among healthy adults, 18-55 years of age, randomized to receive 2 doses, separated by 21 days, of 10 g, 30 g, or 100 g of BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified, mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RBD. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.8- to 2.8-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J.

The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).\n\nMethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).\n\nResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.\n\nConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Chaix","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris"},{"author_name":"Marc Wirden","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Univ Paris 06-UMR_S 1136, Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, F-75005, Paris, France INSERM-UMR_S 1136, Pierre "},{"author_name":"Linda Feghoul","author_inst":"APHP Hospital Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"M\u00e9lanie Bertine","author_inst":"IAME"},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure N\u00e9r\u00e9","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Quentin Le Hingrat","author_inst":"IAME, UMR 1137, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, AP-HP, Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Bichat, AP-HP, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"David Boutolleau","author_inst":"Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Constance Delaugerre","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Genevi\u00e8ve Marcelin","author_inst":"Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, INSERM U 943 and Pierre et Marie Curie University"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard"},{"author_name":"Jerome LeGoff","author_inst":"Paris Diderot University and APHP - H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard - APHP - IAME, UMR 1137, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"},{"author_name":"Warren Kalina","author_inst":"Pfizer, Inc.

In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lelde Kalnina","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"\u00c0ngels Mateu-Regu\u00e9","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Oerum","author_inst":"CNRS\/Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"},{"author_name":"Annemette Hald","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Jan Gerstoft","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Henrik Oerum","author_inst":"CIVI Biopharma Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 is limited. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. Results. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received [&ge;]1 dose of favipiravir. Of these, 27.0% required an O2-nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and\/or high-flow O2-therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and\/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5(0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7%[53.7-78.0%] in all patients, 92.5%[75.7%-99.1%] in patients who did not require O2-supplementation, and 47.2%[0.4%-64.5%] in patients who required O2-supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement [odds ratio (95%CI); p-value]: older age [0.94 (0.89 to 0.99); p=0.04], higher baseline NEWS2 score [0.64 (0.47 to 0.88); p=0.006], and lower favipiravir loading dose ([&le;]45 mg\/kg\/day) [0.04 (0.005 to 0.4); p=0.006]. Conclusions. Our study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir ([&ge;]45 mg\/kg\/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pinyo Rattanaumpawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Supunnee Jirajariyavej","author_inst":"Taksin Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kanokorn Lerdlamyong","author_inst":"Vachira Phuket Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nattawan Palavutitotai","author_inst":"Lerdsin Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jatuporn Saiyarin","author_inst":"Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Oerum","author_inst":"CIVI Biopharma Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ulrik Stervbo","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Sven Rahmann","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Toralf Roch","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Timm Henning Westhoff","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Nina Babel","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis.

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinghua Lu","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Peter D.

Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.\n\nMethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.\n\nResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.\n\nConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Wylezich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Sten Calvelage","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Kore Schlottau","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Ute Ziegler","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Pohlmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dirk Hoeper","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Luke R Green","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Parsons","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Tucker","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Danielle Groves","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Katie Johnson","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Laura Carrilero","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Joe Heffer","author_inst":"IT Services, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"David Partridge","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascul"},{"author_name":"Cariad Evans","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Razza","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Alexanda J Keeley","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascul"},{"author_name":"Nikki Smith","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Dennis Wang","author_inst":"Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Fo"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sahin","author_inst":"BioNTech, Mainz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin U.

As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors.

Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values which vary inversely with the genome size generally.

The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.\n\nAt the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.\n\nOur finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1\/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries. These results have the potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological information and the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meriem Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Souad Kartti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarek Alouane","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Rokia Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Center, Moroccan Foundation for Science, Innovation & Research (MAScIR), Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Loubna Allam","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Mouna Ouadghiri","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"M.W.

Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

One injection of tocilizumab led to rapid improvements in clinical features, inflammatory findings, and oxygen supply in seven patients with severe COVID-19 and substantial amelioration in two patients who were critically ill, whereas four patients, who exhibited rapidly worsened respiratory function, required artificial ventilatory support even after tocilizumab treatment.

The database contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Including the three new samples and excluding samples with missing annotations, we analyzed 7, 643 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using principal component analysis computed on a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index, we find that the newly discovered virus genomes from Beijing are in a genetic cluster that consists mostly of cases from Europe and South(east) Asia. The sequences of the new cases are most related to virus genomes from a small number of cases from China (March 2020), cases from Europe (February to early May 2020), and cases from South(east) Asia (May to June 2020).

Here, we show that S1-Fc antigen delivery targeting the Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cell compartment elicits anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-antigen specific IgG production in vivo exerting biologically functional and protective activity against live virus infection, assessed in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay in vitro. The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our promising findings on rS1-Fc protein immunization prompted us to further develop an affordable and safe product for delivery to our communities in need for COVID-19 vaccinations.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Herrmann","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Junki Maruyama","author_inst":"Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Chanyu Yue","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Christoph Lahtz","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Heyue Zhou","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Lisa Kerwin","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Whenzong Guo","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Wlliam Soo Hoo","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Soonpin Yei","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sunkuk Kwon","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Fu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sachi Johnson","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Arthur Ledesma","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yiran Zhuang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yingcong Zhuang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Elena Yei","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Adamus","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Slobodan Praessler","author_inst":"Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Toshio Tanaka","author_inst":"Osaka Habikino Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Rachid Mentag","author_inst":"Biotechnology Unit, Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Rabat, National Institute of Agricultural Research, Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.175778","rel_title":"Single-cell transcriptional atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) provides insight into the cellular mechanisms which enable bats to be viral reservoirs","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.175778","rel_abs":"Bats are a major \"viral reservoir\" in nature and there is a great interest in not only the cell biology of their innate and adaptive immune systems, but also in the expression patterns of receptors used for cellular entry by viruses with potential cross-species transmission. To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Brian Quinlan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Haiyong Peng","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Insititute"},{"author_name":"Yan Guo","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shoujiao Peng","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Insitute"},{"author_name":"Meredith Davis-Gardner","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Gardner","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zhi Xiang Voo","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles C Bailey","author_inst":"Emmune Inc."},{"author_name":"Michael Alpert","author_inst":"Emmune, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christoph Rader","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hyeryun Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jingchuan Zhong","author_inst":"National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of M"},{"author_name":"Hongping Wu","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingkun Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation"},{"author_name":"Stephen R.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr\/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies\/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amorce Lima","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vicki Healer","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Vendrone","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suzane Silbert","author_inst":"Tampa General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stuart Weston","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Holly Hammond","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Lague","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alyse D Portnoff","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Norton","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mimi Guebre-Xabier","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bin Zhou","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kelsey Jacobson","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sonai Maciejewski","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafia Khatoon","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Wisniewska","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Will Mottitt","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stenfanie Kluepfel-Stahl","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Betty Ekechukwu","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Papin","author_inst":"University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, Department of Pathology, Division of Comparative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women. The results were validated using nasopharangeal RNA samples from suspected COVID-19 subjects (n=136). Using RT-PCR as gold standard, the assay was found to have 85.29% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity. The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vinod Kumar","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Suman Mishra","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Rajni Sharma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Agarwal","author_inst":"Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Ujjala Ghoshal","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Tripti Khanna","author_inst":"Indian Council of Medical Research, Ramalingaswami Bhawan, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Lokendra K Sharma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Santosh K Verma","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Swasti Tiwari","author_inst":"Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Prabhakar Mishra","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Sanjay Gandhi PGIMS, Raibareli Road,  Lucknow -226014, India"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhou","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kelsey Jacobson","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sonai Maciejewski","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafia Khatoon","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Malgorzata Wisniewska","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Will Mottitt","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stenfanie Kluepfel-Stahl","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Betty Ekechukwu","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"James Papin","author_inst":"University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, Department of Pathology, Division of Comparative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-\u00c5 and 3.8-\u00c5-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cong Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yanxing Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Caixuan Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenyu Han","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yifan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Qin Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Shutian Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Qiaoyu Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Yalei Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yong Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaijian Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Kong","author_inst":"The National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS)"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Wang","author_inst":"The National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS)"},{"author_name":"Qinyu Zuo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Zhong Huang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology & Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yao Cong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excelle"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed an antiviral dose-response to remdesivir and demonstrated the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a physiologically relevant platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessie Huang","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Adam J Hume","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Kristine M Abo","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Rhiannon B Werder","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Carlos Villacorta-Martin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos D Alysandratos","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Mary Lou Beermann","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Judith Olejnik","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Suder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Esther Bullitt","author_inst":"Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Anne Hinds","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Sharma","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine; Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, University Medical Center Mainz"},{"author_name":"Markus Bosmann","author_inst":"The Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine, and Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center; Ce"},{"author_name":"Finn Hawkins","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Eric J Burks","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Andrew A Wilson","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Elke M\u00fchlberger","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine; National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University"},{"author_name":"Darrell N Kotton","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine of Boston University and Boston Medical Center; The Pulmonary Center and Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Me"},{"author_name":"Sarathi Boddapati","author_inst":"Catalent Paragon Gene Therapy"},{"author_name":"C.

Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models. The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tammy C.T.

Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Malimova","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Abhigyan Satyam","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Michelle Melanson","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Brian T.

A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Carlos Ponce-Rojas","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Michael S.
