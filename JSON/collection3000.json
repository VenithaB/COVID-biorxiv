Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood and easily usable by the general population are needed in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO RDT and the results have been submitted for publication and are currently under review. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by common folk in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use Methods 142 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plants workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use with or without a tutorial video was made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users ability to read the results. Results 88.4 % of the test users judged the instruction for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3 % of the users obtained a valid results and according to the supervisors 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the user. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback toward the COVID PRESTO as a potential self-test. No influence of age and education was observed. Conclusion COVID-PRESTO was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its utilization was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing a promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This RDT can become an easy-to-use tool to help know whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the perspective of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"thierry prazuck","author_inst":"CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jean Phan Van","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Florence sinturel","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"frederique levray","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Allan Elie","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Denise Camera","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"gilles Pialloux","author_inst":"Sorbonne university, hopital Tenon, Paris, france"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20152140","rel_title":"Complexity signatures in the COVID-19 epidemic: power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20152140","rel_abs":"We apply a versatile growth model, whose rate of change is given by a generalised beta distribution, to describe the complex behaviour of the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries in Europe and Asia. We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the death toll but also the risk of resurgence.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani L.

Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with \"protective measures\" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states. Conclusions: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xueting Wang","author_inst":"Goergen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Canruo Zou","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raydonal Ospina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Francisco A.

COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- I IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Simon I Hay","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raydonal Ospina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Francisco A.

METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)\/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Marcos","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca-IBSAL, University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Moncef Belhassen-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Antonio Sanchez- Puente","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Jesus Sampedro-Gomez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Raul Azibeiro","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Ignacio Dorado-Diaz","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Edgar Marcano-Millan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Carol Garcia-Vidal","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Moreiro-Barroso","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Noelia Cubino-Boveda","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez-Alonso","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Daniel Encinas-Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Sonia Pena-Balbuena","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sobejano","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Maria Diez-Campelo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ines","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Cristina Carbonell","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20148494","rel_title":"Outbreak of COVID-19 and Interventions in One of the Largest Jails in the United States: Cook County, IL, 2020","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20148494","rel_abs":"Background: Correctional and detention facilities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to shared space, contact between staff and detained persons, and movement within facilities of detained persons, many with pre-existing medical conditions. On March 18, 2020, Cook County Jail, one of the United States' largest, identified its first suspected case of COVID-19 in a detained person. Methods: This analysis includes SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by molecular detection among detained persons and Cook County Sheriff's Office staff. We examined occurrence of symptomatic cases in each building and proportions of asymptomatic detained persons testing positive. We describe timing of interventions including social distancing, mask use, and expanded testing and show outbreak trajectory in the jail versus contemporaneous case counts in Chicago. Results: During March 1-April 30, 907 symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected among detained persons (n = 628) and staff (n = 279), with nine deaths. Symptomatic cases occurred in all housing divisions; in 9\/13 buildings, staff cases occurred first. Among asymptomatic detained persons in quarantine, 23.6% tested positive. Programmatic activity and visitation stopped March 9, cells were converted into single occupancy beginning March 26, and universal masking was implemented for staff (April 2) and detained persons (April 13). Cases at the jail declined while cases in Chicago increased. Conclusion: Aggressive intervention strategies coupled with widespread diagnostic testing of detained and staff populations can limit introduction and mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in correctional and detention facilities.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chad Zawitz","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Sharon Welbel","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ghinai","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Connie Mennella","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Levin","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Usha Samala","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bryant Smith","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Jane Gubser","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Bridgette Jones","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Kate Varela","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Uzay Kirbiyik","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Josh Rafinski","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Anne Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150938","rel_title":"The Efficacy of IL-6 Inhibitor Tocilizumab in Reducing Severe COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150938","rel_abs":"In the absence of highly effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19. Evaluating the efficacy existing drugs may expedite the development of such therapeutics. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, or cytokine storm, which is largely mediated by the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. Sixteen case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for quantitative synthesis. Combined mortality for the TCZ-treated and SOC groups were 26.0% and 43.4% respectively. In all but one of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC. A combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.453 (95% CI 0.376-0.547, p<0.001). Additionally, eighteen uncontrolled trials were identified for qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 16.0%. Important caveats to this research include the lack of prospective randomized control trials (RCTs) and the absence of data from the large COVATA study from the published literature. However, results from this systematic analysis of published research provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19, validating the ethical basis and merit of ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avi Gurion Kaye","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Siegel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ghinai","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Connie Mennella","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Levin","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Usha Samala","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bryant Smith","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Jane Gubser","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Bridgette Jones","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Kate Varela","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Uzay Kirbiyik","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Josh Rafinski","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Anne Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20147793","rel_title":"Low-Dose Whole-Lung Radiation for COVID-19 Pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20147793","rel_abs":"Background: Safety of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19 pneumonia has been established in two phase I trials. By focally dampening pulmonary cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve outcomes in hospitalized and oxygen-dependent COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or at least until hospital discharge, and compared to an age- and comorbidity-matched control cohort. COVID-19-positive patients eligible for this protocol were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, and serologic responses. Results: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared to ten matched control patients, of whom six received COVID-directed therapy. Median time to clinical recovery was 12 days for the control cohort vs 3 days for LD-RT (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 and 12 days, p=0.19), and intubation rates (40% and 10%, p=0.12) were shorter for the LD-RT cohort. The LD-RT cohort had faster radiographic improvement (p=0.03), even among patients with high COVID burden. Serologic recovery in specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, and inflammatory markers occurred more rapidly following LD-RT than among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including a 3-fold risk reduction in time to clinical improvement, were observed following LD-RT compared to matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the global availability of radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts to investigate the optimal role of LD-RT in COVID-19 pneumonia are justified.

We sought to systematically evaluate the effect of CQ and HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZ) on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published through July 7, 2020. We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, preprints and grey literature. We included studies that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without AZ. We pooled only adjusted effect estimates of mortality using a random effect model and estimated between studies heterogeneity using I2 statistic. We summarized the effect of CQ or HCQ on viral clearance and ICU admission\/ mechanical ventilation. Results Out of 1463 citations screened for eligibility, five RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included (20,263 patients, all hospitalized but with a variable disease severity spectrum). Thirteen studies (1 RCT and 12 cohorts) with 19,573 patients examined the effect of HCQ on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted OR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.96-1.15, I2=0 %, p=0.647). Six cohort studies examined the effect of HCQ and AZ combination among 3430 patients. After excluding a study that examined only patients with cancers, the pooled adjusted OR was (1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.34, I2=0.0%). Two cohort studies and three RCTs found no significant effect of HCQ on viral clearance. One RCT with 48 patients demonstrated improved viral clearance in patients treated with CQ and HCQ. Three cohort studies found that HCQ with or without AZ had no significant effect on mechanical ventilation\/ ICU admission. Conclusion Moderate certainty evidence suggests that HCQ, with or without AZ, lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings are consistent with the recommendations from medical societies that HCQ should only be used to treat COVID-19 patients in the context of clinical trials. Trials of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis are ongoing.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zakariya Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Riaz","author_inst":"Quaid Azam University Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Musa garbati","author_inst":"University of Maiduguri"},{"author_name":"Oweida Aldosary","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Dana Gerberi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Hassan Murad","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Rizwan Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad M Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Walter J Curran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20151084","rel_title":"Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20151084","rel_abs":"Introduction There is a concern that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) induced hypochlorhydria could potentially predispose to severe COVID-19.

In Spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite lacking evidence-based guidance. Objective: To describe clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, including cost implications, immediately following testing availability. Design: Retrospective chart review of patients who received antibody testing from May 14, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Setting: A large academic medical center, one of the first in the US to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians. Patients: 447 consecutive patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Measurements: Clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, cost implications, and comparison with current expert-based guidance from the IDSA and CDC. Results: Of 444 individual antibody test results meeting inclusion criteria, the two most commonly described indications for ordering the antibody test, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n=223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19 compatible illness (n=105) with no previous molecular testing and in asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure or contact with a person with COVID-19 compatible illness (n=60). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (p<0.0001) among those indications inconsistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance. Total cost estimates ranged from $57,720 to $97,680, of which 42% was for testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance. Limitations: The duration of antibody response following infection is unclear and asymptomatic individuals may not develop a positive antibody response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these two groups. Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joesph R Wiencek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Carter L Head","author_inst":"University of Virginia School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Costi D Sifri","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Parsons","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Alok Kumar Dwivedi","author_inst":"Texas Tech University, Paul L Foster School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hemant Goyal","author_inst":"Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"M.Hassan Murad","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Rizwan Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad M Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Walter J Curran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153106","rel_title":"The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153106","rel_abs":"Objectives The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China remains unknown. To reveal the missing information, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang of China. Design Cross-sectional study Setting Three blood centers, located in the central, south and north China, respectively, recruiting from January to April 2020. Participants 38,144 healthy blood donors donated in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang were enrolled, who were all met the criteria for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Main outcome measures Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including total antibody (TAb), IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (IgG-RBD) and nucleoprotein (IgG-N), and IgM. Pseudotype lentivirus-based neutralization test was performed on all TAb-positive samples. In addition, anonymous personal demographic information, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation and educational level, and blood type were collected. Results A total of 519 samples from 410 donors were confirmed by neutralization tests. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors was 2.29% (407\/17,794, 95%CI: 2.08% to 2.52%) in Wuhan, 0.029% (2\/6,810, 95%CI: 0.0081% to 0.11%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0074% (1\/13,540, 95%CI: 0.0013% to 0.042%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. The earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in blood donors was identified on January 20, 2020 in Wuhan. The weekly prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Wuhan's blood donors changed dynamically and were 0.08% (95%CI: 0.02% to 0.28%) during January 15 to 22 (before city lockdown), 3.08% (95%CI: 2.67% to 3.55%) during January 23 to April 7 (city quarantine period) and 2.33% (95%CI: 2.06% to 2.63%) during April 8 to 30 (after lockdown easing). Female and older-age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among donors in Wuhan. Conclusions The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China was low, even in Wuhan city. According to our data, the earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan's donors should not earlier than January, 2020. As most of the population of China remained uninfected during the early wave of COVID-19 pandemic, effective public health measures are still certainly required to block viral spread before a vaccine is widely available.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Le Chang","author_inst":"National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanghen Hou","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Wang","author_inst":"Blood Screenning Laboratory, Hebei Province Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Linfeng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Tingting Xu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Lilin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Ma","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Lan Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Junpeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Jing Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Dong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Ying Yan","author_inst":"National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ru Yang","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Research, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Guo","author_inst":"National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory, Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yingying Su","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Zeng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Wei Han","author_inst":"Blood Screenning Laboratory, Hebei Province Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Tong Cheng","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xia Ningshao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Lunan Wang","author_inst":"National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152447","rel_title":"O Group is a protective factor for COVID19 in Basque population","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152447","rel_abs":"ABO blood groups have been related to COVID19 infection.

Docking studies suggest a putative heparin\/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Mandel Clausen","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Daniel R Sandoval","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Charlotte B Spliid","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Jessica Pihl","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Chelsea D Painter","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Bryan E Thacker","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Charles A Glass","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Anoop Narayanan","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Sydney A Majowicz","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark."},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Torres","author_inst":"Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Gregory J Golden","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Porell","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Aaron F Garretson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface and to drive fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes, thus allowing transfer of viral RNA to the cytosol. Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Armin Bayati","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Francis","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter S McPherson","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Chelsea D Painter","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Bryan E Thacker","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Charles A Glass","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Anoop Narayanan","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Sydney A Majowicz","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark."},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Torres","author_inst":"Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Gregory J Golden","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Porell","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Aaron F Garretson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySyncytia produced by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and regulation of their formation by IFITMs and TMPRSS2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Buchrieser","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Dufloo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Hubert","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Blandine Monel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Delphine Planas","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Maaran Michael Rajah","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Cyril Planchais","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Francoise Porrot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Florence Guivel-Benhassine","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Casartelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Hugo Mouquet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM\/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Miguel Urra","author_inst":"Immunology, Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real, 13005 Ciudad Real, Spain.

This short communication demonstrates how the mutation probability patterns are evolving in 864 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 30 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of four months. Out of these, the mutational probabilities of 25 variants including C14408T (in RdRp gene), A23403G (in spike gene), C6312A (nsp3 gene) are continuously increasing suggesting that these mutations are being propagated with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. In contrast, the mutational probabilities of five variants including C6312A (nsp3 gene), G11083T (nsp6 gene), C28311T (N gene) have significantly decreased in May-June as compared to March-April, suggesting these mutations are being terminated with time.

Here we combine genetics and chemical perturbation to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated entry of SARS-CoV and CoV-2 requires the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as an assisting cofactor: ablation of genes involved in HS biosynthesis or incubating cells with a HS mimetic both inhibit Spike-mediated viral entry. We show that heparin\/HS binds to Spike directly, facilitates the attachment of viral particles to the cell surface to promote cell entry. We screened approved drugs and identified two classes of inhibitors that act via distinct mechanisms to target this entry pathway. Among the drugs characterized, Mitoxantrone is a potent HS inhibitor, while Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to indirectly abrogate HS-assisted viral entry. We further show that drugs of the two classes can be combined to generate a synergized activity against SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect. Altogether, our study establishes HS as an attachment factor that assists SARS coronavirus cell entry, and reveals drugs capable of targeting this important step in the viral life cycle.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Chen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Manju Swaroop","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lihui Wang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Juhyung Lee","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Manisha Pradhan","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Min Shen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Zhiji Luo","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Yue Xu","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Huang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Yihong Ye","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

Methods We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Findings Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Interpretation RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sue Mallett","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Joy Allen","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Sara Graziadio","author_inst":"Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Stuart A Taylor","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Naomi S Sakai","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Kile Green","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Jana Suklan","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Chris Hyde","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals while also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. Objectives: We aimed to identify (1) specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and (2) staff sectors where enhanced strategies for testing might be required. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Results: Of 799 clients, most were young and female with few comorbidities. The most common occupation was nurses followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared to other staff (median: 1.5 vs 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n=105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, chills and history of fever were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms was more predictive of a positive test, but 12\/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. While some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it. Staff testing should form part of a bundle of strategies to protect staff including wearing masks, regular hand washing, buddy screening, physical distancing, availability of PPE and special dispensation for COVID-19-related leave.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Saadiq Moolla","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arifa Parker","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Aslam Parker","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sthembiso Sithole","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Leila Amien","author_inst":"Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rubeena Chiecktey","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Tasneem Bawa","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Abdurasiet Mowlana","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

We analysed published data of five influenza pandemics (such as the Spanish Flu and the Swine Flu) and the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic to describe whether there were subsequent waves and how they differed. Methods We reanalysed literature and WHO reports on SARS-CoV-1 and literature on five influenza pandemics. We report frequencies of second and third waves, wave heights, wavelengths and time between subsequent waves. From this, we estimated peak-to-peak ratios to compare the wave heights, and wave-length-to-wave-length ratios to compare the wavelengths differences in days. Furthermore, we analysed the seasonality of the wave peaks and the time between the peak values of two waves. Results Second waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, were usually about the same height and length as first waves and were observed in 93% of the 57 described epidemic events of influenza pandemics and in 42% of the 19 epidemic events of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic. Third waves occurred in 54% of the 28 influenza and in 11% of the 19 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic events. Third waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, usually peaked higher than second waves with a peak-to-peak ratio of 0.5.

The adaptive model accounts for the development of social mitigation factors, and does especially well at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. The historical data for the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. are analyzed in detail. The parameters of the fits to the two models provide complementary information about the pandemic. The initial infection rate constant was r0 {approx} 0.29 per day for each country, and the effective infection rate constants evolved with time in essentially the same way for each. This suggests that mitigation effects were equally effective in all three countries.

Results In both cases, a frequency peak of one harmonic corresponding to a period of 7.11 days was observed for France and the world. In France, this weekly frequency corresponds to a decrease in deaths every Sunday, whereas for the world the systematic decrease is shifted on average by 1.5 days and corresponds to Saturday or Friday. Conclusion At the world scale and for the epidemic period we confirm the existence of a consecutive weekend effect in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre CONSTANTINESCO","author_inst":"UF6237 - Preclinical Imaging Lab, Imaging Dpt Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg Hopital de Hautepierre 1, Avenue Moliere, F-67098 Strasbourg Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Vincent ISRAEL-JOST","author_inst":"Centre de recherche en Epidemiologie et sante des populations (CESP), Inserm\/Universite Paris-Saclay, Espace ethique\/AP-HP\/Ile-de-France Hopital Saint Louis 1 A"},{"author_name":"Philippe CHOQUET","author_inst":"UF6237 - Preclinical Imaging Lab, Imaging Dpt Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg Hopital de Hautepierre 1, Avenue Moliere, F-67098 Strasbourg Cedex, France"},{"author_name":"Boerge Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Rubeena Chiecktey","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Tasneem Bawa","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Abdurasiet Mowlana","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource receives 24-hourly updates from its full electronic health record, including regularly sourced national mortality on all past and present SLaM service users. The SLaM urban catchment has high levels of deprivation and is ethnically diverse, so the objective of the descriptive analyses reported in this manuscript was to compare mortality in SLaM service users from 16th March to 15th May 2020 to that for the same period in 2019 within specific ethnic groups: i) White British, ii) Other White, iii) Black African\/Caribbean, iv) South Asian, v) Other, and vi) missing\/not stated. For Black African\/Caribbean patients (the largest minority ethnic group) this ratio was 3.33, compared to 2.47 for White British patients. Considering premature mortality (restricting to deaths below age 70), these ratios were 2.74 and 1.96 respectively. Ratios were also high for those from Other ethnic groups (2.63 for all mortality, 3.07 for premature mortality).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Stewart","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jayati Das-Munshi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Boerge Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Rubeena Chiecktey","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Tasneem Bawa","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Abdurasiet Mowlana","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

To understand the demographics of mask wearers and resistors, and the impact of mandates on mask-wearing behavior, we observed shoppers (n = 9935) entering retail stores during periods of June, July, and August 2020. Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a mask. At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age and was also 1.5x greater for females than males. Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas. Mask mandates enacted in late July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small percentage of resistors remained. Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily. Additionally, mask mandates are necessary to increase mask wearing among the public to a level required to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Haischer","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Rachel Beilfuss","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Meggie Rose Hart","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Opielinski","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"David Wrucke","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Zirgaitis","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Toni D Uhrich","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Sandra K Hunter","author_inst":"Marquette University"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amal Ayed","author_inst":"Obstetric and Gynaecology Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Alia Embaireeg","author_inst":"Paediatric Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Benawadth","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Maternity Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Wadha Al-Fouzan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Majeda Hammoud","author_inst":"Paediatrics Department  , Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Monif Alhathal","author_inst":"Neonatal Department, Maternity Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Abeer Alzaydai","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Al-Adan Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Mariam Ayed","author_inst":"Neonatal Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.
