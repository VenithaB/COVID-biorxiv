Mexico has a high number of infected individuals and deaths by COVID-19, as well as an important burden of metabolic diseases. However, reports about features of Mexican individuals with COVID-19 are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate demographic features, clinical characteristics, and the pharmacological treatment of individuals who died by COVID-19 in the south of Mexico. Methods: We performed an observational study including 185 deceased individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Data were retrieved from medical records. Categorical data was expressed as proportions (%) and numerical data were expressed as mean, standard deviation. Comorbidities and overlapping symptoms where plotted as Venn diagrams. Drug clusters were plotted as dendrograms. Results: The mean age was 59.53 years. There was a male predominance (60.1%). The mean hospital stay was 4.75 days. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (88.77%), fever (71.42%) and dry cough (64.28%). Present comorbidities were diabetes (60.63%), hypertension (59.57%) and obesity (43.61%). The main drugs used were azithromycin (60.6%), hydroxychloroquine (53.0%) and oseltamivir (27.3%). Conclusions: Mexican individuals who died of COVID-19 had shorter hospital stays, higher frequency of shortness of breath, and higher prevalence of diabetes compared with individuals from other countries. Also, there was a high frequency of off-label use of drugs for their treatment.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesus Arturo Ruiz-Quinonez Sr.","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Crystell Guzman-Priego Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"German Alberto Nolasco-Rosales Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alfonso Tovilla-Zarate","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Oscar Israel Flores-Barrientos","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Victor Narvaez-Osorio","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe del Carmen Baeza-Flores","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Thelma Beatriz Gonzalez-Castro","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198804","rel_title":"A Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) as a potential tool to prevent collapse of the health care task force during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198804","rel_abs":"Introduction: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where overloaded health systems seem inevitable, there is a need for reliable, conceptually adequate, and easily applied measurement tools to identify health professionals at risk. Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4 Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48). Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health professionals. It carries with it the potential to implement early interventions and to prevent the descent into burnout so common today in the health care task force during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamires Martins Bastos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Massaro Carneiro Monteiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Rogerio Boff Borges","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Carolina Meira Moser","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Daniel Luccas Arenas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Ana Margareth Bassols","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Pricilla Braga Laskoski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.20.20198531","rel_title":"Puerto Rico Health System Resilience After Hurricane Maria: Implications for Disaster Preparedness in the COVID-19 Era","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.20.20198531","rel_abs":"Background: Every year, Puerto Rico faces a hurricane season fraught with potentially catastrophic structural, emotional and health consequences. In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island. Therefore, a resilience framework is a useful tool to help health systems identify areas of improvement in preparation for possible natural disasters.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Rios","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emilia Ling","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ralph Rivera Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus"},{"author_name":"Juan Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198887","rel_title":"The effect of COVID-19 on the economy: evidence from an early adopter of localized lockdowns","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198887","rel_abs":"Background. Governments worldwide have implemented large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing or school closures, to prevent and control the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies, implemented with varying stringency, have imposed substantial social and economic costs to society. As some countries begin to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, lockdowns in smaller geographic areas are increasingly being considered as an attractive policy intervention to mitigate societal costs while controlling epidemic growth. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these decisions. Methods. Drawing from a rich dataset of localized lockdowns in Chile, we used econometric methods to measure the reduction in local economic activity from lockdowns when applied to smaller or larger geographical areas. We measured economic activity by tax collection at the municipality-level. Findings. Results show lockdowns were associated with a 10-15% drop in local economic activity, a two-fold reduction compared to municipalities not under lockdown. A three-to-four-month lockdown had a similar effect on economic activity than the year of the 2009 great recession. We found that costs are proportional to the population under lockdown, without differences when lockdowns were measured at the municipality or city-wide levels. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that localized lockdowns have a large effect on local economic activity, but these effects are proportional to the population under lockdown. Our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size of lockdown areas; the proportional effects of lockdowns on the economy seem to be unchanged by scale.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenzo Asahi","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eduardo A Undurraga","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Valdes","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Wagner","author_inst":"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198911","rel_title":"Environmental impact of Personal Protective Equipment supplied to health and social care services in England in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198911","rel_abs":"Objectives Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) has been central to controlling spread of SARS-CoV2. This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of this, and to model strategies for its reduction. Methods Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE supplied to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use, air freighted, and disposed via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of 1) switching mode of, or eliminating, international travel during supply, 2) reducing glove use 3) using reusable alternatives, 4) maximal recycling. Results The carbon footprint of PPE supplied during the study period totalled 158,838 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields, and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 314 DALYs (disability adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.67 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion costing US $ 20.4 million. Scenario modelling indicated one-third of the carbon footprint could be avoided through switching to shipping, and by 41% through manufacturing PPE in the UK. The carbon footprint was reduced by 83% compared with the base scenario through a combination of UK manufacturing, reducing glove use, using reusable gowns and reuse of face shields, and maximal recycling, estimated to save 259 DALYS, 0.54 species.year, and US $ 15 million due to resource depletion. Conclusions The environmental impact of PPE could be reduced through shipping supplies or domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible, and optimising waste management.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chantelle Rizan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Reed","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mahmood F Bhutta","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Wagner","author_inst":"Universidad Adolfo Ibanez"},{"author_name":"Janine Bruce","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michele Barry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Vinicio de Jesus Perez","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Simone Hauck","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ramon Lopez-Brito","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Carlos Alberto Denis-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Agustin Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Juan Graham Casasus"},{"author_name":"Isela Esther Juarez-Rojop","author_inst":"Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.20199471","rel_title":"Delayed viral clearance and exacerbated airway hyperinflammation in hypertensive COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-09-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.20199471","rel_abs":"In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-patients.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saskia Trump","author_inst":"Molecular Epidemiology Unit, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin I"},{"author_name":"Soeren Lukassen","author_inst":"Center for Digital Health, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Ins"},{"author_name":"Markus S Anker","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology and Metabolism and Department of Cardiology, Charite -  Universitaetsmedizin Berlin;

Aim: To cross-validate manual and automated high-throughput (Roche-cobas6800-Target1\/Target2) testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, to describe detection rates following lockdown and relaxation, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-loads in different specimens. Method: The validation cohort prospectively compared Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas6800-Target1\/Target2 in 1344 naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) taken in calendar week 13 using Basel-ORF8-gene-assay for confirmation. Follow-up-cohort-1 and -2 comprised 12363 and 10207 NOPS taken over 10 weeks until calendar week 24 and 34, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-loads were compared in follow-up NOPS, lower respiratory fluids, and plasma. Results: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%) including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman r>0.95; p<0.001) for all assays. Discordant samples (N=36) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-loads (p<0.001). Following lockdown, weekly detection rates declined to <1% reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% with similarly high SARS-CoV-2-loads, but patients were significantly younger than during lockdown (34 vs 52 years, p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in follow-up NOPS declined by 3log10 copies\/mL within 10 days post-diagnosis (p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2-loads in NOPS correlated weakly with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids and plasma, but remained detectable in 14 and 7 cases of NOPS with undetectable SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Conclusion: Evaluated manual and automated assays are highly concordant and correlate quantitatively. Following successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require dual-target-assays for clinical and epidemiologic assessment. Confirmatory and quantitative follow-up testing should be considered within <5 days, using lower respiratory fluids in symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative NOPS.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karoline Leuzinger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Rainer Gosert","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Kirstine Soegaard","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Klaudia Naegele","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM\/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sawako Hibino","author_inst":"Y's Science Clinic Hiroo, Medical Corporation Koshikai"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hayashida","author_inst":"Boston children's hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrew C Ahn","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yasutaka Hayashida","author_inst":"Y's Science Clinic Hiroo, Medical Corporation Koshikai"},{"author_name":"Julia Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate perceived levels of heat stress and its consequences in HCWs required to wear PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method: An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCWs required to wear Type 1 or 2 PPE in NHS settings to evaluate the perceived impact of PPE on: (1) physical and cognitive performance; (2) heat stress and heat-related symptoms; (3) frequency of removing PPE due to discomfort caused by heat stress; and (4) general working-life and well-being. Results: The survey received 224 responses from 192 (85.7%) women and 32 (14.3%) men. Even though 71.9% of respondents wore the less thermally challenging PPE (i.e. Type 2), a median of 3 (IQR: 2,5) heat-related symptoms were reported including syncope (7.7%). A median of 1 (IQR: 0-3) cognitive task was adversely affected with attentional focus being the most affected. To relieve discomfort, 32.6% reported removing PPE on five or more occasions in a shift. Ninety two percent reported PPE made their job more difficult and 76.2% advised that physical performance was impaired. Respondents also highlighted concerns of dermatitis and pressure sores in the facial region (22.3%) amongst other factors. Conclusion: Heat stress experienced when PPE is worn negatively impacts the performance, safety and well-being of HCWs and patients. Therefore, modification to current working practices and current design of PPE is urgently required to improve HCWs resilience to pandemics of infectious diseases. Results suggest modifications to the design of the protective face mask and strict enforcement of specific work\/rest ratios to limit the duration of PPE use would be immediate impactful interventions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Lee Davey","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Ben James Lee","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Timothy Robbins","author_inst":"University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Harpal Randeva","author_inst":"University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Charles Doug Thake","author_inst":"Occupational and Environmental Physiology Group, Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences,  (CSELS), Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry Universit"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19. Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. . Results: Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative. Conclusion: In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes in patients with Covid-19 are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with Ayurveda.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhimanyu Kumar","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Govind Prasad","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Srivastav","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Vinod Kumar Gautam","author_inst":"Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Neha Sharma","author_inst":"Aarogyam (UK) CIC, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Martin Siegemund","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daiana Stolz","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Tamm","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

T cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood and proved to be much more meaningful than classical readouts with PBMCs. Monocytes responded stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially reversed T cell anergy.

The obtained results show an inverse correlation between ground level ozone concentration and the daily number of COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oskar Wisniewski","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun"},{"author_name":"Wieslaw Kozak","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun"},{"author_name":"Maciej Wisniewski","author_inst":"ImmQuest"},{"author_name":"Jan-Niklas Salewski","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frederike Winter","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Buchtler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Maximilian V Malfertheiner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across socio-demographic groups is an imminent and crucial public policy challenge given that (1) the eventual vaccine supply will be highly constrained for at least the first several months of the vaccination campaign, and (2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from SARS-CoV-2 across groups. Previous experience with vaccine development mid-pandemic offers limited insights for SARS-CoV-2 prioritization: SARS and Zika vaccine development was incomplete when those outbreaks ended and the epidemiology of endemic human influenza viruses differ substantially from that of SARS-CoV-2. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited and dynamic COVID-19 vaccine supply in the U.S. across socio-demographic groups differentiated by age and essential worker status. The transmission dynamics are modeled using a compartmental (SEIR) model parameterized to capture our current understanding of the transmission and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate tradeoffs between three alternative policy objectives: minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths. Moreover, we model dynamic vaccine prioritization policies that respond to changes in the epidemiological status of the population as SARS-CoV-2 continues its march. Because contacts tend to be concentrated within age groups, there is diminishing marginal returns as vaccination coverage increases in a given group, increasing the group's protective immunity against infection and mortality. We find that optimal prioritization consistently targets older essential workers. However, depending on the policy objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to minimize infections or seniors in order to minimize mortality. Optimal prioritization outperforms non-targeted vaccination strategies by up to 18% depending on the outcome optimized. For example, in our baseline model, cumulative mortality decreased on average by 17% (25,000 deaths in the U.S. population) over the course of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack Hoyt Buckner","author_inst":"Graduate Group in Ecology, University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Hoyt Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael R Springborn","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jan-Niklas Salewski","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frederike Winter","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Buchtler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Maximilian V Malfertheiner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

This was an observational study with a cross-sectional and time series design based on data from the information system of the State Department of Health of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The microdata from the epidemiological bulletin is open and in the public domain; consultation was carried out from March to July 2020. The incidences were stratified per 100,000 inhabitants. The cross-section study was conducted to describe COVID-19 cases, and the trend analysis was performed using polynomial regression models for time series, with R-Studio software and a significance level of 5%. There was a predominance of women among the cases, and of men in terms of deaths. The presence of comorbidities was statistically related to mortality, particularly lung disease and diabetes, and the mean age of the deaths was 67.7 years. Even though the macro-region of the state capital, Campo Grande, had a higher number of cases, the most fatalities were in the macro-region of Corumba. The trend curve demonstrated discreet growth in the incidence of cases between epidemiological weeks 11 and 19, with a significant increase in week 20 throughout the state. The trend for COVID-19 in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul was upward and regular, but there was an important and alarming exponential increase. The health authorities should adopt the necessary measures to enforce health precautions and encourage social distancing of the population so that health services will be able to care for those afflicted by the disease, especially older people, those with comorbidities, and vulnerable sectors of the population.

This study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM's low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online in the entire Brazilian territory (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using an adapted version of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: Only 44.4% of the sample presented high levels of well-being. Low psychological well-being appeared associated with the youngest age group (PR: 2.76; CI95%: 1.90-4.01), polyamorous relationships (PR: 2.78; CI95%: 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR: 6.27; CI95%: 4.42-8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR: 1.63; CI95%: 1.06-2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR: 1.80; CI95%: 1.04-3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR: 2.67; CI95%: 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR: 1.82; CI95%: 1.23-2.69) Conclusion: The well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. Policy Implications: Planning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM's resilience through the adoption of safe strategies and behavior.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emerson Lucas Silva Camargo","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribei\u00e3ro Preto"},{"author_name":"Bruna Isabela Adolpho de Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto"},{"author_name":"Igor  Fessina Siffoni","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Anderson Reis de Sousa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Jules Ramon Brito Teixeira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal da Bahia"},{"author_name":"Isabel Amelia Costa Mendes","author_inst":"Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Francisco Lopes de Sousa","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Its emergence has warranted the need to reorganize maternity services for childbirth. However, it is not known if this comes at an additional cost to women. We conducted a hospital-based cost analysis to estimate the out-of-pocket cost of spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and caesarean delivery (CD). Specifically, we collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 who were managed between 1st April and 30th August 2020 at the largest teaching hospital in Lagos, the epicentre of COVID-19 in Nigeria. We compared the mean facility-based costs for the cohort with costs paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying major cost drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. Findings showed that total utilization cost ranged from US$494 (N190,150) for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US$4,553 (N1,751,165) for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32-66% of facility-based cost has been subsidized, cost of SVD and CD have doubled and tripled respectively during the pandemic compared to those paid pre-COVID. Out of the facility-based costs paid, cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) was the major cost driver (50%) for SVD and CD. Supplemental oxygen was a major cost driver when women had severe COVID-19 symptoms and required long admission (48%). Excluding treatment costs specifically for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs for SVD and CD are US$228 (N87,750) and US$948 (N364,551) respectively. Our study demonstrates that despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive. Regulation of the PPE and medical oxygen supply chain can help drive down utilization cost and reduce mark-ups being passed to users. The pandemic offers an opportunity to expand advocacy for subscription to health insurance schemes in order to avoid any catastrophic health expenditure.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Christian Chigozie Makwe","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mobolanle Balogun","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bosede Bukola Afolabi","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Theresa Amaogechukwu Alex-Nwangwu","author_inst":"Lagos University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charles Anawo Ameh","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Francisco Lopes de Sousa","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthias Lubnow","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Dirk Lunz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalised cohorts (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24) and studies of PLWH across all settings (HR 2.08, 95%CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower-quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF)-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by comorbidities. Conclusion: Evidence is emerging that suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of TDF is warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maya Mellor","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Anne Bast","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Jones","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia Roberts","author_inst":"Outreach Librarian Knowledge Centre, Bodleian Health Care Libraries, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Jose Ordonez-Mena","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Found"},{"author_name":"Alastair Reith","author_inst":"Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher C Butler","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Founda"},{"author_name":"Jienchi Dorward","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University "},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

Methods: We integrated patient symptom and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS CoV 2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on thirteen symptoms, estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID 19 compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (78%) or cough (77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11) or hospital care (n=44). 51% (n=28) were female, 49% were age <60. Common comorbidities included diabetes (22%), hypertension (27%), cancer (16%) and cardiovascular disease (13%). 69% of these (n=38) were RT-PCR confirmed positive for SARS CoV2 infection, 11 had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS CoV2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6 to 84.2%, specificities of 58.8 to 70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4 to 71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices. Conclusions: Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS CoV2 infection in real world settings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chistopher D'Ambrosia","author_inst":"University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Henrik Christensen","author_inst":"University of California San Diego, Department of Computer Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Eliah Aronoff-Spencer","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Paris Perdikaris","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Founda"},{"author_name":"Jienchi Dorward","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University "},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

For precise policy making, accurate and efficient forecasts of confirmed cases and death counts are important. In this work, we used five different univariate time series models including; Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Nonparametric Autoregressive (NPAR) and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) models for forecasting confirmed, death and recovered cases. These models were applied to Pakistan COVID-19 data, covering the period from 10, March to 3, July 2020. To evaluate models accuracy, computed two standard mean errors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The findings show that the time series models are useful in predicting COVID-19 confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Furthermore, MA model outperformed the rest of all models for confirmed and deaths counts prediction, while ARMA is second best model. The SES model seems superior to other models for prediction of recovered counts, however MA is competitive. On the basis of best selected models, we forecast form 4th July to 14th August, 2020, which will be helpful for decision making of public health and other sectors of Pakistan.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasnain Iftikhar","author_inst":"Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Moeeba Iftikhar","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, University of Peshawar, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Eliah Aronoff-Spencer","author_inst":"UC San Diego"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Paris Perdikaris","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Founda"},{"author_name":"Jienchi Dorward","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa, University "},{"author_name":"Bernhard Graf","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Florian Hitzenbichler","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Frank Hanses","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Poeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Marina Kreutz","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Orso","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a diagnosis strategy based on a combination of antigen and IgM\/IgG serological RDTs. Methods: Plasma and nasopharyngeal samples were collected between 14 March and 11 April 2020 at hospital admission from 45 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 20 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) was assessed in nasopharyngeal swabs using the Coris Respi-Strip. For IgM\/IgG detection, SureScreen Diagnostics and Szybio Biotech RDTs were used in addition to laboratory assays (Abbott Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Theradiag COVID-19 IgM ELISA). Results: Using the Ag RDT, 13 out of 45 (29.0%) specimens tested positive, the sensitivity was 87.0% for Cycle Threshold (CT) values [&le;] 25 and 0% for CT values > 25. IgG detection was associated with high CT values and the amount of time after the onset of symptoms. The profile of isolated IgM on RDTs was more frequently observed during the first and second week after the onset of symptoms. The combination of Ag and IgM\/IgG RDTs enabled the detection of up to 84.0% of COVID-19 confirmed cases at hospital admission. Conclusion: Antigen and antibody-based RDTs showed suboptimal performances when used alone. However when used in combination, they are able to identify most COVID-19 patients admitted in an emergency department.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Veyrenche","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karine Bollore","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Amandine Pisoni","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bedin","author_inst":"Montpellier University"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Mondain","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques Ducos","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michel Segondy","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Montes","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrick Pastor","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van De Perre","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edouard Tuaillon","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ralph Burkhardt","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Tanja Niedermair","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Brochhausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Andre Gessner","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Bernd Salzberger","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Matthias Mack","author_inst":"University Hospital Regensburg"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with severe disease. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also important clinically. Methods: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate the major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects, then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infections as controls. Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 93 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (e.g. hematological\/liver and renal function\/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking\/drinking habits) were included as predictors. XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Results: A total of 1191 severe and 358 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=1747), our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.668 and 0.712 for severe and fatal infections respectively. Since only pre-diagnostic clinical data were available, the main objective of this analysis was to identify baseline risk factors. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, waist-hip ratio(WHR), HbA1c, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), urea and WHR. In subsequent analyses involving the whole UKBB population (N for controls=489987), the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.669 and 0.749. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and cystatin C. We also uncovered other features of potential relevance, including testosterone, IGF-1 levels, red cell distribution width (RDW) and lymphocyte percentage. Conclusions: We identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe\/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe\/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth C.Y.

FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient therapy. Our studies underscore that while possible, ventilator multiplexing is a complicated synergy between machine settings, circuit modification, and patient monitoring. Consequently, ventilator multiplexing is reserved only as a last emergency resource, by trained clinicians and respiratory therapists with ventilator operative experience.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helen Xun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Shallal","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Justin Unger","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Runhan Tao","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

We present an improved method to estimate Rt and its application to routine surveillance data from Greece. Methods: Our method extends that of Cori et al (2013), adding Bayesian imputation of missing symptom onset dates, imputation of infection times using an external estimate of the incubation period, and an adjustment for reporting delay. To facilitate its use, we provide an R software package named \"bayEStim\". We applied the method to COVID-19 surveillance data from Greece, and examined the resulting Rt estimates in relation to control measures applied, in order to assess their effectiveness. We also associated Rt, as a measure of transmissibility, to population mobility as recorded in Google data and to ambient temperature. We used a serial interval between 4 and 7.5 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days. Results: In Greece Rt fell rapidly as the first control measures were introduced, dropping below 1 at least a week before a full lockdown came into effect. In mid-July Rt started increasing again, as increased mobility associated with tourism activity was observed. Each 10% of increase in relative mobility increased Rt by 8.1% (95% CrI 6.1-10.2%), whereas each unit celsius of temperature increase decreased Rt by 4.6% (95% CrI 5.4-13.7%). Conclusions: Mobility patterns significantly affect Rt. Most of the reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility in Greece occurred already before the lockdown, likely as a result of decreased population mobility. Lower viral transmissibility in summer does not appear sufficient to counterbalance the increased mobility due to tourism. Monitoring Rt is an essential component of COVID-19 surveillance, and it is crucial for correctly assessing the effect of control measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodore Lytras","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Vana Sypsa","author_inst":"Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Demosthenes Panagiotakos","author_inst":"School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Implementing such policies need a good understanding of the systems dynamics, generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with complex and continuous feedback loops. As a result, we use agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis through applying some policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, providing good emergency and hospitalization strategies, and preventing traveling would lead to reduce the infection rates. Based on imperial college modeling studies that prove increasing levels of interventions could slow down the spread of disease and infection cases as much as possible, and taking into account that social distancing policy is considered to be the most important factor that was recommended to follow. Our proposed model is designed to test if increasing the social distancing policies strictness can slow down the spread of disease significantly or not, and find out what is the required safe level of social distancing. So, the model was run six times with six different percentages of social distancing with keeping the other parameters levels fixed for all experiments. The results of our study show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, where the spread of disease and infection rates decrease once social distancing procedures are implemented at higher levels. Also, the behavior space tool was used to run ten experiments with different levels of social distancing which enough more supported the previous results. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels led to significantly reduced infection rates which result in decreasing deaths. Both types of experiments prove that 80\\% to 100\\% of following social distancing policies reduces the infection rates dramatically.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Talal Daghriri","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Ozlem Ozmen","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Demosthenes Panagiotakos","author_inst":"School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

Nevertheless, restriction of travel and social distancing rules were put in place days before the first case was detected. During the next two months, the number of cases grew gradually to 77 cases, followed by a rapid spread that has produced 3691 confirmed cases and 80 deaths by the end of July 2020. The turning point on 26 May 2020 was preceded three weeks earlier by the arrival of the first of a series of flights repatriating Libyans who became stranded abroad when air travel was suspended. In the first weeks of the surge, the number of cases was particularly high in the less densely populated southern region, raising questions about the implementation of social distancing and other protective measures in that region. The epidemic in Libya was modeled using the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model of infectious disease epidemics. Three scenarios were developed based on three estimates of the fraction of the population exposed to the disease (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5%). The modeling portrays the peak of the epidemic around early August and estimates that the number of deaths will flatten out around early November at between 250 and 600, depending on the parameter employed. More deaths than those estimated implies that is more widespread than assumed. Greater promotion of awareness and understanding of social distancing practices and their value is needed, particularly in the south, and better protection of the elderly should decrease mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Bredan","author_inst":"Independent scholar, previously with Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, and VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Hani Benamer","author_inst":"Neurology Department, New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Omran Bakoush","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine & Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE, and Department of Nephrology, Lund Univers"},{"author_name":"Sotirios Tsiodras","author_inst":"4th Department of Internal Medicine, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Alberto Torres","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Michael Vladimirov","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Frye","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Mohit Singhala","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -

We compare five epidemiological models for forecasting and assessing the course of the pandemic. We compare how the models analyze case-recovery-death count data in India, the country with second highest reported case-counts in a world where a large proportion of infections remain undetected. A baseline curve-fitting model is introduced, in addition to three compartmental models: an extended SIR (eSIR) model, an expanded SEIR model developed to account for infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (SAPHIRE), another SEIR model to handle high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of tests (SEIR-fansy). A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model developed at the Imperial College London (ICM) is also examined. Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error (MSRPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SEIR-fansy yields an SMAPE value of 0.72, and the eSIR model yields a value of 33.83. For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 for baseline model, 23.10 for eSIR, 2.07 for SAPHIRE and 3.20 for SEIR-fansy. For cumulative death counts, the SEIR-fansy model performs the best, with an SMAPE of 7.13, as compared to 26.30 for the eSIR model. Using Pearson correlation coefficient and Lin concordance correlation coefficient, for cumulative case counts, the baseline model exhibits highest correlation (both Pearson as well as Lin coefficients), while for cumulative death counts, projections from SEIR-fansy exhibit the best performance: For cumulative cases, correlation coefficients computed for the baseline model are 1 (Pearson) and 0.991 (Lin). For eSIR, those values are 0.985 (Pearson) and 0.316 (Lin). For SAPHIRE, we compute 1 (Pearson) and 0.975 (Lin). Finally, for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 1 (Pearson) and 0.965 (Lin). Similarly, for cumulative deaths, correlation coefficients computed for eSIR is 0.978 (Pearson) and 0.206 (Lin), and for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 0.999 (Pearson) and 0.742 (Lin). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) and note that on both dates, the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (June 30: 6.10 and July 10: 6.24) and cumulative deaths (June 30: 3.62 and July 10: 3.99) for both dates, while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (June 30: 27.79 and July 10: 26.74).","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumik Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Ritwik Bhaduri","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Ritoban Kundu","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Xuelin Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Brockett Horne","author_inst":"Maryland Institute College of Art"},{"author_name":"Pooja Yesantharao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bo Soo Kim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Broc Burke","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Montana","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Talcott","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradford Winters","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Frisella","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bradley Kushner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Sacks","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Guest","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Systems Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Sung Hoon Kang","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Julie Caffrey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Charite -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin, and Berlin Institut"},{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite -
