Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 360 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from 2nd June to 5th July 2020. Kaplan Meier plots, median survival times, and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Association between time to recovery\/ convalescence and determinants was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard survival model, where hazard ratio, P-value, and 95% CI for hazard ratio were used for testing significance. Results: The mean age of the participants was 32.4 years (+\/_ 12.5 years). On admission, 86.9 % had mild COVID-19, 78.6% were asymptomatic and 11.4% of the patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness. The Median time to recovery\/ convalescence among the study population was 16 days. The log-rank test shows that having non-mild (moderate and severe) disease, having one or more symptoms at presentation, and presenting with respiratory and constitutional symptoms seems to extend the time needed to achieve recovery. The Final Cox regression result shows that the presence of symptom at presentation was found to be a significant factor that affects time to recovery\/ convalescence, the rate of achieving recovery\/ convalescence among symptomatic patients was 44% lower than patients who were asymptomatic at presentation (HR= 0.560, 95% CI= 0.322-0.975, p-value=0.040). Conclusions: Presence of symptom was found to be associated with delayed viral clearance. This implies symptomatic patients are more likely to be infectious because of the prolonged viral shedding in addition to the presence of a more concentrated virus in the upper respiratory tract that enhances the transmission. Therefore, attention should be given in the isolation and treatment practice of COVID-19 patients with regard to presence of symptom.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tigist Workneh Leulseged","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Ishmael Shemsedin Hassen","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Endalkachew Hailu Maru","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Wuletaw Chane Zewde","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Nigat W\/Hawaryat Chamesew","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kalkidan Tilahun Yegile","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Abdi Bekele Bayisa","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Tariku Bahiru Jagema","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Teketel Tilahun Admasu","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mesay Gemechu Edo","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Eyosias Kebede Gurara","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Meseret Damte Hassen","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Etsegenet Yeshitla Menyelshewa","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Firaol Mame Abdi","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Mahlet Birhanu Tefera","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.20208520","rel_title":"Variability of Salivary and Nasal Specimens for SARS-CoV-2 Detection","rel_date":"2020-10-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.20208520","rel_abs":"In a large cohort of ambulatory confirmed COVID-19 patients with multiple self-collected sample time points, we compared 202 matched nasal-oropharyngeal swabs and oral salivary fluid sample pairs by RT-PCR.

This left us with limited understanding of COVID-19 transmission in children until several states reopened schools for the 2020-2021 school year. While early school closures were likely beneficial in protecting children in the initial stages of the pandemic in the U.S., long-term closures pose significant cumulative effects in children who rely on schools for instruction and additional social services, and for parents who need to balance work and childcare obligations. Reopening schools safely is a high priority for many interested stakeholders. Proposed in-person school reopening plans include traditional, 100% school capacity, five days per week instruction, hybrid scenarios with reduced in-person instruction and virtual learning, and various reduced school capacity schedules with non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. To assess the potential impacts of different reopening plans, we created a modified SIR-type transmission model that captures multiple known pathways of COVID-19 transmission in a 100,000-person community. Our results show that plans that utilize consecutive days in school and divide students into separated smaller cohorts who attend school together, as well as plans that emphasize distance learning, are better able to suppress disease spread and reduce risk from an introduced infective into the community. Plans with more consecutive school days are protective for both the schoolchildren and surrounding community by acting to separate the larger intermixing population into smaller intermixing subpopulations. The \"Five-Day Switch\" plan, which separates students into two cohorts, each of whom attend in-person learning for five consecutive days followed by five days of distance learning, best captures these protective attributes. All modeled plans assumed initially disease-free communities and that children's interactions with the community are greatly reduced during instructional days, both for in-person and distance learning.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney D Shelley","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Philippa S Chadwick","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Carrie Manore","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sara Y Del Valle","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"James Higginson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Emrys Jones","author_inst":"Waters Corporation"},{"author_name":"Eftychios Manoli","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Vincen Wu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stefania Stavrakaki","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James McKenzie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel McGill","author_inst":"Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"Hanifa Koguna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zoltan Takats","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.20208686","rel_title":"An Innovative Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention to Mitigate SARS-CoV02 Spread: Probability Sampling to Identify and Isolate Asymptomatic Cases","rel_date":"2020-10-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.20208686","rel_abs":"Studies estimate that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs through individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. Mitigation strategies test only those who are moderately to severely symptomatic, excluding the substantial portion of cases that are asymptomatic yet still infectious and likely responsible for a large proportion of the virus spread (1-8). While isolating asymptomatic cases will be necessary to effectively control viral spread, these cases are functionally invisible and there is no current method to identify them for isolation. To address this major omission in COVID-19 control, we develop a strategy, Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), for identifying and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic. STQ uses probability sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, then isolates the individuals who test positive along with their household members who are high probability for asymptomatic infections. To test the potential efficacy of STQ, we use an agent-based model, designed to computationally simulate the epidemic in the Seattle with infection parameters, like R0 and asymptomatic fraction, derived from population data. Our results suggest that STQ can substantially slow and decrease the spread of COVID-19, even in the absence of school and work shutdowns. Results also recommend which sampling techniques, frequency of implementation, and population subject to isolation are most efficient in reducing spread with limited numbers of tests.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie E Williams","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xiaozheng Yao","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Ankita Pall","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xiaolu Qian","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mansi Rathod","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Chang Xu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adrian Dobra","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Vincen Wu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stefania Stavrakaki","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James McKenzie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel McGill","author_inst":"Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"Hanifa Koguna","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zoltan Takats","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.20208421","rel_title":"Forecasting COVID-19 cases in the Philippines using various mathematical models","rel_date":"2020-10-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.20208421","rel_abs":"Due to the rapid increase of COVID-19 infection cases in many countries such as the Philippines, many efforts in forecasting the daily infections have been made in order to better manage the pandemic, and respond effectively.

A single parameter semi-empirical model was developed, calibrated, and validated with prevalence predictions from two independent data-driven mathematical epidemiological models, each of which was separately validated using available cumulative infection estimates from recent state-wide serological testing in 6 states. The analysis shows that individually, reported case rates and test positivity rates may provide substantially biased estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission trends in the U.S. However, the COVID-19 prevalence for U.S. states from March-July, 2020 is well approximated, with a 7-day lag, by the geometric mean of reported case and test positivity rates averaged over the previous 14 days. Predictions of this semi-empirical model are at least 10-fold more accurate than either test positivity or reported case rates alone, with accuracy that remains relatively constant across different US states and varying testing rates. The use of this simple and readily-available surrogate metric for COVID-19 prevalence, that is more accurate than test positivity and reported case rates and does not rely on mathematical modeling, may provide more reliable information for decision makers to make effective state-level decisions as to public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the US.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weihsueh chiu","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Martial L Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Ben Paul C Dela Cruz","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Edd Francis O.

We find that the combination of these interventions reduced the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from 1.7 to 1.1, which was sufficient to avoid saturation of hospitals. We estimate that thanks to the young demographics across the territory, the risk of hospitalisation following infection was 0.3 times that of metropolitan France and that about 20% of the population was infected by July.

Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FDA authorized serology tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sources: A search of MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus, and EMBASE up to April 4, 2020, was performed to identify studies using the \"COVID 19 testing\" and \"meta-analysis.\" FDA website was accessed for the list of tests for emergency use authorization (EUA). Study Selection: Manufacturer reported serology tests published in the FDA website were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the selected reports. Data extraction and synthesis: The meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bivariate analysis using the \"random-effects model\" was applied for pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the serology test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subgroup analysis of the diagnostic accuracy with lag time between symptom onset and testing were studied. Results: Seven manufacturer listed reports were included. The pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI, 78% - 93%), the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI, 97% - 100%), and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97.

Prior rural health research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in remote parts of the U.S. To understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions. Kendalls Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH). Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county designation. Results show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than other ADI component measures. Though most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county type reinforced this observation but revealed no moderating effect of county type on ADI.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Kitchen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins, School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elham Hatef","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hsien Yen Chang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Weiner","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hadi Kharrazi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins, School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Noemie Lefrancq","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Nacher","author_inst":"Centre d'Investigation Clinique Antilles Guyane, CIC INSERM 1424, Centre Hospitalier Andree Rosemon"},{"author_name":"Felix Djossou","author_inst":"Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne"},{"author_name":"Alice Sanna","author_inst":"Agence Regionale de Sante de Guyane"},{"author_name":"Claude Flamand","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Guyane"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Cyril Rousseau","author_inst":"Sante Publique France Guyane"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zoltan Takats","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.07.20208702","rel_title":"Long-term COVID-19 symptoms in a large unselected population","rel_date":"2020-10-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.07.20208702","rel_abs":"It is increasingly recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can produce long-term complications after recovery from the acute effects of infection. Here, we report the analysis of 32 self-reported short and long-term symptoms in a general adult population cohort comprised of 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, and 17,474 non-tested individuals. The majority of our COVID-19+ cases are mild, with only 8 of the 233 COVID-19+ cases having been hospitalized. Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer. In contrast, only 8.6% of participants from the general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer than 30 days due to any illness during the same study period. The long-term symptoms most enriched in those with COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain with deep breaths, dizziness, and tachycardia. We additionally observe that individuals who had an initial symptom of dyspnea are significantly more likely to develop long-term symptoms. Importantly, our study finds that the overall level of illness is an important variable to account for when assessing the statistical significance of symptoms that are associated with COVID-19. Our study provides a baseline from which to understand the frequency of COVID-19 long-term symptoms at the population level and demonstrates that, although those most likely to develop long-term COVID-19 complications are those who initially have more severe illness, even those with mild or asymptomatic courses of infection are at increased risk of long-term complications.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Cirulli","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Kelly M Schiabor Barrett","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Stephen Riffle","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolze","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Iva Neveux","author_inst":"Desert Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shaun Dabe","author_inst":"Renown Health"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Grzymski","author_inst":"Desert Research Institute"},{"author_name":"James T Lu","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Washington","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Claude Flamand","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Guyane"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Cyril Rousseau","author_inst":"Sante Publique France Guyane"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zoltan Takats","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.08.20209650","rel_title":"Absence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in pre-pandemic sera from individuals with recent seasonal coronavirus infection","rel_date":"2020-10-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.08.20209650","rel_abs":"Cross-reactive immune responses elicited by seasonal coronaviruses might impact SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and disease outcomes.

Understanding how these unprecedented measures impacted population behaviour and contact patterns is key to predict more accurately the health, social and economic impacts of such extreme actions if they were to be applied to future outbreaks. We set up an online survey to measure how the lockdown affected social contact patterns in France, and collected information from 42,036 participants aged 18 years and over between April 10 and April 28, 2020. Among the participants who normally worked outside home prior to the lockdown (72% of the survey population), 68% reported that they had moved to working from home and 17% reported being unemployed during the lockdown. Only 2% of participants used public transport during lockdown, as opposed to 37% before it. Participants reported increased frequency of washing hands, switch in greeting behaviour, but generally limited use of masks outside home. 138,934 contacts were reported, with an average 3.3 contacts per individual per day (1.7 for individuals aged >65 years old compared to 3.6 for younger age-groups). This represented a 70% reduction compared with previous surveys, consistent with reductions in transmission rates measured during the lockdown. Contacts in workplaces, shops, and transports on the previous day were respectively reported in only 11%, 31% and 0.5% of the participants. For those who maintained a professional activity outside home, the frequency of contacts at work dropped by 79%. This study shows that the lockdown dramatically affected population's behavior, work, risk perception and contact patterns. Both frequency and heterogeneity of contacts were affected, impacting potential important features of virus dissemination. Such surveys are essential to evaluate more accurately the impact of past or future lockdowns and anticipate epidemic dynamics in these conditions.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paolo Bosetti","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bich-Tram Huynh","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Armiya Youssouf Abdou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marie Sanchez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Eisenhauer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"No\u00e9mie Courtejoie","author_inst":"DREES, French Ministry for Health"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Accardo","author_inst":"Insee (French National Statistical Institute)"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Didier Guillemot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre","author_inst":"Association DataCovid"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'\u00e9pid\u00e9miologie et de Sant&eacute Publique"},{"author_name":"Guillaume B\u00e9raud","author_inst":"Infectious diseases department, University hospital of Poitiers"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lulla Opatowski","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Zoltan Takats","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Siham Seid Ali","author_inst":"Millennium COVID-19 Care Center, St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.10.06.20207209","rel_title":"DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING COVID-19 ADVERSE OUTCOME RISK PREDICTION MODELS FROM A BI-NATIONAL EUROPEAN COHORT OF 5594 PATIENTS.","rel_date":"2020-10-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.10.06.20207209","rel_abs":"Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 have overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission) and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and death. Methods: From a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944 cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation. Findings: The ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and 0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission. Interpretation: ML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more important in more severe cases. We provide access to an online risk calculator based on these findings.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Espen Jimenez Solem","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg"},{"author_name":"Tonny Studsgaard Petersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg"},{"author_name":"Christina Lioma","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Christian Igel","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Wouter Boomsma","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Oswin Krause","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Casper Hansen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Christian Hansen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Stephan Lorentzen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Raghavendra Selvan","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Janne Petersen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg"},{"author_name":"Martin Erik Nyeland","author_inst":"Copenhagen Univ.

Data from HCWs (n=3,458) were included in the analysis. Data from first responders (n=226) were also analyzed for comparison. A blood sample was collected at study enrollment and 8-week follow-up. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Comparisons to estimated community prevalence were also evaluated. Observed antibody prevalence was 0.93% and 2.58% at initial and 8-week follow-up, respectively, for HCWs, and 5.31% and 4.35% for first responders. For HCWs, significant differences (p < .05) between negative vs. positive at initial assessment were found for age, race, fever, and loss of smell, and at 8-week follow-up for age, race, and all symptoms. Antibody positivity persisted at least 8 weeks in this cohort. Among 75 HCWs with self-reported prior PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 35 (46.7%) were antibody negative. Significant differences between negative vs. positive were observed in age and frequency of symptoms. This study found considerably lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among HCWs compared with prior published studies. This may be explained by better safety measures in the workplace, heightened awareness inside and outside of the workplace, possibly lower susceptibility due to innate immunity and other biological heterogeneity, and low COVID-19 prevalence in the community itself. HCWs with initial positive results had persistent positive serologies at 8 weeks. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing such lower prevalence in our HCWs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Brant-Zawadzki","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Deborah Fridman","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Philip Robinson","author_inst":"Infection Prevention, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zahn","author_inst":"Orange County Healthcare Agency"},{"author_name":"Clayton Chau","author_inst":"Orange County Healthcare Agency"},{"author_name":"Randy German","author_inst":"Laboratory Administrative Services, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Marcus Breit","author_inst":"Hoag Family Cancer Institute, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Elmira Burke","author_inst":"Quality Management, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Jason R.

Understanding the district level correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR) is essential for formulating policies and intervention. Objectives The present study examines the association between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of India's population and the COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level. Data and Methods Using crowdsourced data on the COVID-19 prevalence rate, we analyzed state and district level variation in India from March 14 to July 31, 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out a regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio. Results The results showed that the IR is 42.38 per one hundred thousand population in India. The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.6), and was the lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.1). About 80 percent of infected cases and 90 percent of deaths were observed in nine Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat). Moreover, we observed COVID-19 cold-spots in central, northern, western, and north-eastern regions of India. Out of 736 districts, six metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Thane, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) emerged as the major hotspots in India, containing around 30 percent of confirmed total COVID-19 cases in the country. Simultaneously, parts of the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, part of Delhi, the southern part of Tamil Nadu, the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir were identified as hotspots of COVID-19 infection. Moran's- I value of 0.333showed a positive spatial clustering level in the COVID-19 IR case over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis found that district-level population density ({beta}: 0.05, CI:004-0.06), the percent of urban population ({beta}:3.08, CI: 1.05-5.11), percent of Scheduled Caste Population ({beta}: 3.92, CI: 0.12-7.72),and district-level testing ratio ({beta}: 0.03, CI: 0.01-0.04) are positively associated with the prevalence of COVID-19. Conclusion COVID-19 cases were heavily concentrated in 9 states of India. Several demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables are correlated with the COVID-19 prevalence rate. However, after adjusting the role of socioeconomic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection rate was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher population density, a higher percentage of the urban population, and a higher percentage of deprived castes and with a higher level of testing ratio.

This study aims to provide preliminary information about the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among students attending Italian schools. Methods Data are extracted and analysed from an open access, online dataset that monitor, on a daily basis, media news about SARS-CoV-2 infections of students attending Italian schools. Results As of 5 October 2020, a total of 1350 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been registered in the Italian territory schools (involving 1059 students, 145 teachers and 146 other school members), for a total of 1212 out of 65104 (1.8%) Italian schools involved. National schools reported only 1 case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in more than 90% of cases, and only in one high school a cluster of more than 10 cases have been described (P 0.015). The detection of one or more SARS-CoV-2 infections leaded to the closure of 192 (14.2%) entire schools, more frequently nursery\/kindergartens (P <0.0005). Discussion Our preliminary data support low transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within schools, at least among younger students. However, entire schools are frequently closed in the fear of larger outbreaks. Continuous monitoring of school settings, hopefully through daily updated open access datasets, are needed to better understand the impact of schools on the pandemic, and provide guidelines that better consider different risks within different age groups.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danilo Buonsenso","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Design: A Clinical trial registry of India registered observational study (CTRI\/2020\/05\/025247). Setting: Certified COVID hospital located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Participants: 549 COVID positive patients hospitalized between 15 th May to 10 th August, 2020 and treated in ICU and non ICU settings. Main Outcome Measure: Comparative analysis of demographic, clinical characteristics, investigations, treatment, complications and outcome of COVID patients in ICU and non ICU settings. Results: Of the 549 hospitalized COVID positive patients, 159 were admitted in ICU during disease course while 390 had ward admissions. Overall median age was 52 (1-86) years. The ICU group was older (>65years), with associated comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes (p<0.001); higher proportion of males (79.25%); with dyspnea as a major clinical characteristic and consolidation in lungs as a major radiological finding as compared to ward patients. C - reactive protein, D-Dimer and Ferritin were higher in ICU patients. Overall 50% females depicted elevated Ferritin levels. Steriods(92.45%)and tocilizumab (69.18%) were more frequently used for ICU patients . Remdesivir was prescribed to both ICU and non ICU patients. Favirapir was also a line of treatment for 25% of ICU patients. Convalescent plasma therapy was given to 7 ICU patients. Complications like acute kidney injury (13.84%), shock (10.69 %), sepsis and encephalopathy were observed in ICU patients. Overall mortality rate was 5.47 % with higher mortality among males in comparison to females (p<0.0001). Conclusion: About 29% of overall patients required ICU admission that was commonly elderly males. Chances of ICU admission were higher with baselines comorbidities (1.5 times) and dyspnea (3.4 times) respectively. A multi-specialty COVID care team and updated treatment protocols improves outcomes.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Patel","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Parloop Bhatt","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Madan","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nitesh Shah","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vipul Thakkar","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bhagyesh Shah","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Chovatia","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hardik Shah","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Minesh Patel","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pradip Dabhi","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aditi Nanavati","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Milan Chag","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyur Parikh","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Anderson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C Goodwin","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Karen M Puopolo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Nicki Detlefsen","author_inst":"Denmarks Technical University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lauritzen","author_inst":"Dep.of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Abraham George Smith","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marleen de Bruijne","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Bulat Ibragimov","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Jens Petersen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Martin Lillholm","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marie Helleberg","author_inst":"Copenhagen Univ.

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequalae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London NHS Trust during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1,946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three Respiratory Units in the trust. Results: Increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 67% of survivors, with 42% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms. Conclusions: Understanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be vital in preparing for further peaks of the pandemic. Our initial follow up data suggest there are ongoing sequalae of COVID-19 including persistent symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Further data, including longer term follow up data, are necessary to improve our understanding of this novel pathogen and associated disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daryl Cheng","author_inst":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Calderwood","author_inst":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Erik Skyllberg","author_inst":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Adam Ainley","author_inst":"Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vipul Thakkar","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bhagyesh Shah","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Chovatia","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hardik Shah","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Minesh Patel","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Pradip Dabhi","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aditi Nanavati","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Milan Chag","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyur Parikh","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Anderson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C Goodwin","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Karen M Puopolo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Nicki Detlefsen","author_inst":"Denmarks Technical University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lauritzen","author_inst":"Dep.of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Abraham George Smith","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marleen de Bruijne","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Bulat Ibragimov","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Jens Petersen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Martin Lillholm","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marie Helleberg","author_inst":"Copenhagen Univ.

Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. Setting: Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service. Participants: 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results: 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population. We urgently need to quantify how much risk is due to COVID-19 infection and how much is due to disruption to healthcare services, in order to inform better guidance about shielding, access to healthcare and vaccine priorities for people with rare diseases.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily J Peach","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Megan Rutter","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Peter C Lanyon","author_inst":"Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Grainge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Richard B Hubbard","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Aston","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Bythell","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sarah Stevens","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Fiona A Pearce","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Pradip Dabhi","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aditi Nanavati","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Milan Chag","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Keyur Parikh","author_inst":"Care Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Anderson","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Eileen C Goodwin","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Karen M Puopolo","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Nicki Detlefsen","author_inst":"Denmarks Technical University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lauritzen","author_inst":"Dep.of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Abraham George Smith","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marleen de Bruijne","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Bulat Ibragimov","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Jens Petersen","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Martin Lillholm","author_inst":"Dep. of Computer Science, Univ. of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Marie Helleberg","author_inst":"Copenhagen Univ.

During the first wave of the global pandemic, an extended laboratory testing panel was integrated into the local pathway to guide triage and healthcare resource utilisation for emergency admissions. We conducted a retrospective service evaluation to determine the utility of extended tests (D-dimer, ferritin, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin) compared to the core panel (full blood count, urea & electrolytes, liver function tests, C-reactive protein). Methods Clinical outcomes for adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 17th March to 30st June 2020 were extracted, alongside costs estimates for individual tests. Prognostic performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 28-day mortality used as the primary endpoint, and a composite of 28-day intensive care escalation or mortality for secondary analysis. Results From 13,500 emergency attendances we identified 391 unique adults admitted with COVID-19. Of these, 113 died (29%) and 151 (39%) reached the composite endpoint. Core test variables adjusted for age, gender and index of deprivation had a prognostic AUC of 0.79 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.67 to 0.91) for mortality and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.84) for the composite endpoint. Addition of extended test components did not improve upon this. Conclusion Our findings suggest use of the extended laboratory testing panel to risk stratify community-acquired COVID-19-positive patients on admission adds limited prognostic value. We suggest laboratory requesting should be targeted to patients with specific clinical indications.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J Ponsford","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University; Immunodeficiency Center for Wales, University Hospital for Wales, Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Ross J Burton","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Leitchan Smith","author_inst":"University Hospital of Wales, Information & Technology Team Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Palwasha Khan","author_inst":"1.

We reaffirm that vaccination alone may be insufficient to achieve herd immunity in some settings, and that additional intervention measures may be required. Nevertheless, we show that optimizing the allocation of vaccine doses can more than double their effectiveness.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael T Meehan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Daniel G Cocks","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Caldwell","author_inst":"University of Hawaii at Manoa"},{"author_name":"James M Trauer","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adeshina I Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Romain R Ragonnet","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Emma S McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Matthias Eberl","author_inst":"1.

We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19. Methods In patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from routine laboratory investigations. Results On admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells\/ml and median CRP CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg\/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg\/L respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients, admission WCC >8.2x106 cells\/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire Y Mason","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Kanitkar","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Charlotte J Richardson","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Marisa Lanzman","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Zak Stone","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tabitha Mahungu","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Damien Mack","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Q Wey","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lucy Lamb","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Indran Balakrishnan","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pollara","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Manish Pandey","author_inst":"Cardiff and Vale UHB, Adult Critical Care Directorate Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Stephen Jolles","author_inst":"University of Wales Hospital, Immunodeficiency Center for Wales Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Underwood","author_inst":"1.

Among the severe outbreaks across South America, Uruguay has become known for curtailing SARS-CoV-2 exceptionally well. To understand the SARS-CoV-2 introductions, local transmissions, and associations with genomic and clinical parameters in Uruguay, we sequenced the viral genomes of 44 outpatients and inpatients in a private healthcare system in its capital, Montevideo, from March to May 2020. We performed a phylogeographic analysis using sequences from our cohort and other studies that indicate a minimum of 23 independent introductions into Uruguay, resulting in five major transmission clusters. Our data suggest that most introductions resulting in chains of transmission originate from other South American countries, with the earliest seeding of the virus in late February 2020, weeks before the borders were closed to all non-citizens and a partial lockdown implemented. Genetic analyses suggest a dominance of S and G clades (G, GH, GR) that make up >90% of the viral strains in our study. In our cohort, lethal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlated with arterial hypertension, kidney failure, and ICU admission (FDR < 0.01), but not with any mutation in a structural or non-structural protein, such as the spike D614G mutation. Our study contributes genetic, phylodynamic, and clinical correlation data about the exceptionally well-curbed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Uruguay, which furthers the understanding of disease patterns and regional aspects of the pandemic in Latin America.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria Elizondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Gordon W Harkins","author_inst":"South African Medical Research Council Capacity Development Unit, South African National Bioinformatics Institute, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, So"},{"author_name":"Batsirai Mabvakure","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Sabine Smidt","author_inst":"South African Medical Research Council Capacity Development Unit, South African National Bioinformatics Institute, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, So"},{"author_name":"Paul Zappile","author_inst":"Genome Technology Center, Office for Science and Research, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Christian Marier","author_inst":"Genome Technology Center, Office for Science and Research, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Matthew T Maurano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Victoria Perez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Natalia Mazza","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Carolina Beloso","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Silvana Ifran","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Mariana Fernandez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Andrea Santini","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Veronica Perez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Veronica Estevez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Matilde Nin","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Manrique","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Leticia Perez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Ross","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Susana Boschi","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Maria Noel Zubillaga","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.

This study aimed to define the predictors of critical illness development within 28 days postadmission. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study including 477 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul from March 12 to May 12, 2020. The development of critical illness, e.g., invasive mechanical ventilation and\/or death, was followed for a period of 28 days postadmission. Demographic characteristics, number of comorbidities, illness severity at admission defined by the WHO scale, vital signs, laboratory findings and period of admission to the hospital were independent variables. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed, and the C-index was calculated. Results The median (IQR) age of the cohort was 55.0 (44.0-67.0) years, and 50.1% were male. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, dyspnea and fatigue. Overall, 65.2% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Hydroxychloroquine was given to 99.2% of the patients. Critical illness developed in 45 (9.4%; 95% CI: 7.0%-12.4%) patients. In the multivariable analysis, age (HR: 1.05, p<0.001), number of comorbidities (HR: 1.33, p=0.02), procalcitonin [&ge;]0.25 g\/L (HR: 2.12, p=0.03) and LDH [&ge;]350 U\/L (HR: 2.04, p=0.03) were independently associated with critical illness development. The WHO scale on admission was the strongest predictor of critical illness (HR: 4.15, p<0.001). Prognosis improved within the study period (p<0.05). The C-index of the model was 0.92. Conclusions Age, comorbidity number, WHO scale, LDH and procalcitonin were independently associated with critical illness development. Mortality from COVID-19 seems to be decreasing as the pandemic advances.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uluhan Sili","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Pinar Ay","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Topuzoglu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Huseyin Bilgin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Elif Tukenmez Tigen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Buket Erturk Sengel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Dilek Yagci Caglayik","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Baran Balcan","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Derya Kocakaya","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turke"},{"author_name":"Sehnaz Olgun Yildizeli","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Fethi Gul","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Beliz Bilgili","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Rabia Can Sarinoglu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Aysegul Karahasan Yagci","author_inst":"Department of Medical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Lutfiye Mulazimoglu Durmusoglu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Emel Eryuksel","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Zekaver Odabasi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Haner Direskeneli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sait Karakurt","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ismail Cinel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Volkan Korten","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.

Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression and thus might represent a useful biomarker. Methods: We run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations. Findings: Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 mcgg\/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV2 infected cells. Interpretation: SZC is a novel biomarker to predict COVID-19 outcome. We encourage performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marina Vogel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Marc Tallo-Parra","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Victor Herrera-Fernandez","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Gemma Perez-Vilaro","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel Chillon","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Institute of Neurosciences, Edifici H, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, E-08193, Bellaterra, Spain."},{"author_name":"Xavier Nogues","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERFES"},{"author_name":"Silvia Gomez-Zorrilla","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Inmaculada Lopez-Montesinos","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Sorli-Redo","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Horcajada","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Natalia Garcia-Giralt","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juana Diez","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ruben Vicente","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Robert Guerri-Fernandez","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Zekaver Odabasi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Haner Direskeneli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sait Karakurt","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ismail Cinel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Volkan Korten","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.

We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant. This study emphasizes the need for mechanistically investigating differential modulation of the COVID-associated coagulation cascades by enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin Pawlowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Christian Kirkup","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Berner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Sorli-Redo","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Horcajada","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Natalia Garcia-Giralt","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juana Diez","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ruben Vicente","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Robert Guerri-Fernandez","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Zekaver Odabasi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Haner Direskeneli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sait Karakurt","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ismail Cinel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Volkan Korten","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.

Methods Surrogate clinical specimens were prepared by inoculating foam and polyester nasal swabs with residual SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens diluted in porcine or human matrix. Dry swab elution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was evaluated by vortex, swab swirling, and passive methodologies. Surrogate and clinical nasal specimen stability were evaluated at refrigerated (4C) and elevated temperatures (40C for 12 hours, 32C hold) through 72 hours. Results Polyester swabs demonstrated equivalent performance to foam swabs for detection of low and high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Dry swab elution performed with PBS and mechanical disruption by vortex resulted in nearly complete quantitative recovery of virus. Dry polyester and foam surrogate specimens were stable through 72 hours both when refrigerated and after high temperature excursion, which simulated specimen transport without cold chain. Similarly, clinical specimens collected with polyester swabs and stored dry were stable through 72 hours in the presence and absence of cold chain. Polyester surrogate specimens stored in saline were stable through 72 hours refrigerated but only through 48 hours at elevated temperatures. Conclusions Polyester nasal swabs stored in dry collection tubes comprise a robust and inexpensive self-collection method for SARS-CoV-2 viral load testing, which is stable under conditions required for home collection and shipment to the laboratory.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Douglas Rains","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Leah R Padgett","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Charlotte L Ahls","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Delini K Samarasinghe","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Michelle L Wallander","author_inst":"Sciest LLC"},{"author_name":"Lauren A Kennington","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Po Tu","author_inst":"The Everett Clinic --Part of Optum"},{"author_name":"James S Elliott","author_inst":"Quantigen Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Sorli-Redo","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Horcajada","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Natalia Garcia-Giralt","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juana Diez","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ruben Vicente","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Robert Guerri-Fernandez","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Zekaver Odabasi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Haner Direskeneli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sait Karakurt","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ismail Cinel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Volkan Korten","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.

Traditional individual surveillance testing via nasal swabs and\/or saliva is among the measures that colleges are pursuing to reduce the spread of the virus on campus. Additionally, some colleges are testing wastewater on their campuses for signs of infection, which can provide an early warning signal for campuses to locate COVID-positive individuals. However, a representation of wastewater surveillance has not yet been incorporated into epidemiological models for college campuses, nor has the efficacy of wastewater screening been evaluated relative to traditional individual surveillance testing, within the structure of these models. Here, we implement a new model component for wastewater surveillance within an established epidemiological model for college campuses. We use a hypothetical residential university to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater surveillance to maintain low infection rates. We find that wastewater sampling with a 1-day lag to initiate individual screening tests, plus completing the subsequent tests within a 4-day period can keep overall infections within 5% of the infection rates seen with traditional individual surveillance testing. Our results also indicate that wastewater surveillance can be an effective way to dramatically reduce the number of false positive cases by identifying subpopulations for surveillance testing where infectious individuals are more likely to be found. Through a Monte Carlo risk analysis, we find that surveillance testing that relies solely on wastewater sampling can be fragile against scenarios with high viral reproductive numbers and high rates of infection of campus community members by outside sources. These results point to the practical importance of additional surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus on campus and the necessity of a proactive response to the initial signs of outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tony E Wong","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"George M Thurston","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel Barlow","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Nathan Cahill","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lucia Carichino","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kara Maki","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"David Ross","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schneider","author_inst":"Rochester Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Sorli-Redo","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Juan Pablo Horcajada","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Natalia Garcia-Giralt","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juana Diez","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Group, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ruben Vicente","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain."},{"author_name":"Robert Guerri-Fernandez","author_inst":"Institut Mar d'Investigacions Mediques, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; CIBERF"},{"author_name":"Zekaver Odabasi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Haner Direskeneli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sait Karakurt","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Ismail Cinel","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Volkan Korten","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Raquel Balleste","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Asociacion Espanola Primera en Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"author_name":"Simon Dellicour","author_inst":"Spatial Epidemiology Lab.
