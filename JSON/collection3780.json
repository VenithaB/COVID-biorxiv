Therefore, to reduce the transmission of this pathogen, several countries have taken many intervention measures. In this paper, we show that the impact of these measures in India is different from several other countries. It is shown that an early lockdown in late March 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of COVID-19 to a linear one, but a surge in the number of cases from late April 2020 brought India back to a quadratic trajectory. A regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states. It is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests, and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread. This insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for India nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions. Nonetheless, future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data, and a comparative study is presented. In the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections, these projections will have a limited accuracy: with that limitation, the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through September 2020.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajesh Ranjan","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129825","rel_title":"National Smoking Rates Correlate Inversely with COVID-19 Mortality","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129825","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Introduction: Recent studies show cigarette smokers are markedly under-represented among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in over a dozen countries. It is unclear if this may be related to confounding factors such as age distribution, access to care, and inaccurate records. We hypothesized that these concerns could be avoided by studying smoking prevalence in relation to COVID-19 mortality. Since climate has been identified as a factor in COVID-19, we studied groups of countries with relatively comparable temperatures. Methods: The 20 hottest and 20 coldest countries in the Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis database with a minimum mortality rate of .3 deaths\/100,000 were selected on the basis of the average temperatures of their largest city. Mortality rates were determined as of May 1, 2020 and correlated with national smoking rate adjusting for sex ratio, obesity, temperature, and elderly population. Results: A highly significant inverse correlation between current daily smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate was noted for the group of hot countries (R=-.718, p = .0002), cold countries (R=-.567, p=.0046), and the combined group (R=-.324, p=.0207). However, after adjustments only the regression for hot countries and the combined group remained significant. In hot countries, for each percentage point increase in smoking rate mortality decreased by .147 per 100,000 population (95% CI .102- 192, p=.0066). This resulted in mortality rates several-fold elevated in the countries with the lowest smoking rates relative to the highest smoking rates. In the combined group, mortality decreased by .257 per 100,000 population (95% CI .175-.339, p=.0034). Discussion: These findings add support to the finding of an inverse relationship between current smoking and seriously symptomatic COVID-19. However, we conclude that the difference in mortality between the highest and lowest smoking countries appears too large to be due primarily to the effects of smoking per se. A potentially beneficial effect of smoking is surprising, but compatible with a number of hypothetical mechanisms which deserve exploration: 1) Studies show smoking alters ACE2 expression which may affect COVID-19 infection or its progression to serious lung pathology. 2) Nicotine has anti-inflammatory activity and also appears to alter ACE2 expression. 3) Nitric oxide in cigarette smoke is known to be effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and has shown in vitro antiviral effects including against SARS-CoV-2. 4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19. 5) Smokers are exposed to hot vapors which may stimulate immunity in the respiratory tract by various heat-related mechanisms (e.g. heat shock proteins). Studies of steam and sauna treatments have shown efficacy in other viral respiratory conditions. At this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized. The interaction of smoking and COVID-19 will only be reliably determined by carefully designed prospective study, and there is reason to believe that there are unknown confounds that may be spuriously suggesting a protective effect of smoking. However, the magnitude of the apparent inverse association of COVID-19 and smoking and its myriad clinical implications suggest the importance of further investigation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Norden","author_inst":"U of Washington (retired)"},{"author_name":"David H.

Despite the efforts, the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited. In the present manuscript, we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in Italy by using the data collected over the last three months. Our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one. Despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations, the analysis of the Italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic. Indeed, we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months. This implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases. Unfortunately, the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks, as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution. Moreover, we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country ({approx}13.5%). Since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide, this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people, likely due to the presence of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals in the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicole Balasco","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging - CNR"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo d'Alessandro","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Smaldone","author_inst":"IRCCS - SDN"},{"author_name":"Luigi Vitagliano","author_inst":"Italian National Research Council"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129833","rel_title":"How much leeway is there to relax COVID-19 control measures?","rel_date":"2020-06-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129833","rel_abs":"Following successful widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions aiming to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions are moving towards reopening economies and borders.

We estimate the risks associated with different levels of reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We find widely varying leeway to reopen, high risks of exceeding past peak sizes, and high possible burdens per introduced case per week, up to hundreds in some jurisdictions.

Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. We analyze the performance of a screening strategy proposed in Tuscany (Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. Methods. We simulate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity=0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. Results. Assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11167.6 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Costs and false negatives increase with the prevalence. Conclusions. The analyzed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michela Baccini","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Mattei","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Emilia Rocco","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Giulia Vannucci","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Fabrizia Mealli","author_inst":"University of Florence"},{"author_name":"Rebeca C.

Because the patterns of the occurrence of new confirmed cases and deaths over time are complex and seemingly country-specific, estimating the long-term pandemic spread is challenging. I developed a simple transformation algorithm to investigate the characteristics of the case and death time series per nation, and described the universal similarities observed in the transformed time series of 19 nations in the Group of Twenty (G20). To investigate the universal similarities among the cumulative profiles of confirmed cases and deaths of 19 individual nations in the G20, a transformation algorithm of the time series data sets was developed with open-source software programs. The algorithm was used to extract and analyze statistical information from daily updated COVID-19 pandemic data sets from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Two new parameters for each nation were suggested as factors for time-shifting and time-scaling to define reduced time, which was used to quantify the degree of universal similarities among nations. After the cumulative confirmed case and death profiles of a nation were transformed by using reduced time, most of the 19 nations, with few exceptions, had transformed profiles that closely converged to those of Italy after the onset of cases and deaths. The initial profiles of the cumulative confirmed cases per nation universally showed 3 - 4 week latency periods, during which the total number of cases remained at approximately ten. The latency period of the cumulative number of deaths was approximately half the latency number of cumulative cases, and subsequent uncontrollable increases in human deaths seemed unavoidable because the coronavirus had already widely spread. Immediate governmental actions, including responsive public-health policy-making and enforcement, are observed to be critical to minimize (and possibly stop) further infections and subsequent deaths. In the pandemic spread of infectious viral diseases, such as COVID-19 studied in this work, different nations show dissimilar and seemingly uncorrelated time series profiles of infected cases and deaths. After these statistical phenomena were viewed as identical events occurring at a distinct rate in each country, the reported algorithm of the data transformation using the reduced time revealed a nation-independent, universal profile (especially initial periods of the pandemic spread) from which a nation-specific, predictive estimation could be made and used to assist in immediate public-health policy-making.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert S Kim","author_inst":"University of Hawaii at Manoa"},{"author_name":"Siegfried Burggraf","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Czibere","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Tobias Fleige","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Michael Spannagl","author_inst":"Haemophilia Treatment Centre, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich"},{"author_name":"David Watts","author_inst":"School of Medical Sciences and Photon Science Institute, University of Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Marc Becker","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Naveed Z.

Material and methods- We used repeatedly tested positive clinical sample elutes having different levels of SARS CoV 2 RNA and negative sample elutes to prepare seven series of 11 pools each, having pool sizes ranging from 2 to 48 samples to estimate the optimal pool size.

Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies promote the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ye Qiu","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Qiong Wang","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Yan Li","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Ce-Heng Liao","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Xing-Yi Ge","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Marc Becker","author_inst":"Laboratory Becker & Colleagues"},{"author_name":"Naveed Z.

Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 protein (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter deaminates C into U residues leading to dysfunctional transcripts. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP may act as primary selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus by considering a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, Bovine CoV, Murine MHV, Porcine HEV, and Canine CoV). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas viruses that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. In SARS-CoV-2, CpG is most deficient in the S protein region to evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense during cell entry. Furthermore, over four months of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history, we observed a marked increase in C to U substitutions in the 5 UTR and ORF1ab regions. This suggests that the two regions could be under constant C to U deamination by APOBEC3. The evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yulong Wei","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Jordan R.

In this study, we targeted for a design of multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. We considered the structural proteins S, E and, M of SARS-CoV-2, since they facilitate the infection of the virus into host cell and using different bioinformatics tools and servers, we predicted multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes having potential for the required vaccine design. Phylogenetic analysis provided insight on ancestral molecular changes and molecular evolutionary relationship of S, E, and M proteins. Based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of these proteins, eight epitopes were selected by various B cell and T cell epitope prediction tools. Molecular docking was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes and three potential epitopes WTAGAAAYY, YVYSRVKNL, and GTITVEELK were selected for their noticeable higher binding affinity scores -9.1, -7.4, and -7.0 kcal\/mol, respectively. Targeted epitopes had 91.09% population coverage worldwide. In summary, we identified three epitopes having the most significant properties of designing the peptide-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arpita Singha Roy","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Mahafujul Islam Quadery Tonmoy","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Atqiya Fariha","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Ithmam Hami","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Khalil Afif","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Md Adnan Munim","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Rahanur Alam","author_inst":"Department of Food Technology and Nutrition Science, Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Md.

It has been reported that a few conditions, including cancer, predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe form of COVID-19. These findings led us to evaluate the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection by investigation of ACE2 expression in their tumor tissues. The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2 gene promoter in COAD patients. Surprisingly, this methylation status has a strong negative correlation with ACE2 gene expression. The functional enrichment analysis of the genes that had similar expression patterns with ACE2 in colon cancer tissues demonstrated that they mainly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur relay system, and Fat digestion and absorption pathways. Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients. In conclusion, it has plausible that COAD patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experience severe injuries. Moreover, COVID-19 would bring unfavorable survival outcomes of patients with colon cancer by the way of immune cell infiltration linked process.

The mechanisms of altered susceptibility to viral acquisition and\/or severe disease in at-risk groups are poorly understood. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used in the treatment of COPD but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients with a COPD to risk of increased COVID-19 severity is unknown. Here, using a combination of human and animal in vitro and in vivo disease models, we show that ICS administration attenuates pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. This effect was mechanistically driven by suppression of type I interferon as exogenous interferon-{beta} reversed ACE2 downregulation by ICS. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-\/{beta} receptor (Ifnar1-\/-) also had reduced expression of ACE2.

The extracellular region of TMPRSS-2, -3, -4, and MSPL are composed of LDLA, SRCR, and SPD domains. MSPL can cleave the consensus multibasic (R-X-X\/R-R) and monobasic (Q(E)-T\/X-R) motifs on HA, while TMPRSS2 or -4 only cleaves monobasic motifs. To better understand HA cleavage mediated by MSPL, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with the furin inhibitor. The structure revealed that three domains are gathered around the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the SPD domain. The furin inhibitor structure shows that the side chain of P1-Arg inserts into the highly conserved S1 pocket, whereas the side chain of P2-Lys interacts with the Asp\/Glu-rich 99 loop that is unique to MSPL. We also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is identified as an initiator of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model suggests that TMPRSS2 is more suitable for Ala\/Val residues at the P2 site than Lys\/Arg residues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayako Ohno","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Nobuo Maita","author_inst":"Division of Disease Proteomics, Institute of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Tabata","author_inst":"Laboratory for Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Research Center, Asahikasei Pharma"},{"author_name":"Hikaru Nagano","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Kyohei Arita","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medical Life Science, Yokohama City University"},{"author_name":"Mariko Ariyoshi","author_inst":"Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takayuki Uchida","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Reiko Nakao","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Anayt Ulla","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Kosuke Sugiura","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Koji Kishimoto","author_inst":"Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Shigetada Teshima-Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nikawa","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Loic Carrique","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.148296","rel_title":"DeepEMhacer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.148296","rel_abs":"Cryo-EM maps are valuable sources of information for protein structure modeling. However, due to the loss of contrast at high frequencies, they generally need to be post-processed to improve their interpretability. Most popular approaches, based on B-factor correction, suffer from limitations. For instance, they ignore the heterogeneity in the map local quality that reconstructions tend to exhibit. Aiming to overcome these problems, we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental maps and maps sharpened using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step. DeepEMhancer was evaluated on a testing set of 20 different experimental maps, showing its ability to obtain much cleaner and more detailed versions of the experimental maps. Additionally, we illustrated the benefits of DeepEMhancer on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruben Sanchez Garcia","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Josue Gomez-Blanco","author_inst":"Departament of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ana Cuervo","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Carazo","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Carlos Oscar S Sorzano","author_inst":"National Center of Biotechnology (CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Javier Vargas","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Takayuki Uchida","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Reiko Nakao","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Anayt Ulla","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Kosuke Sugiura","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Koji Kishimoto","author_inst":"Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Shigetada Teshima-Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nikawa","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Loic Carrique","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129999","rel_title":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Southern California Reveals Community Transmission Pathways in the Early Stage of the US COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129999","rel_abs":"Given the higher mortality rate and widespread phenomenon of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) within the United States (US) population, understanding the mutational pattern of SARS CoV-2 has global implications for detection and therapy to prevent further escalation. Los Angeles has become an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the US. Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require identifying its genetic and geographic variation and understanding the drivers of these differences. For the first time, we report genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates in the Los Angeles population using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Samples collected at Cedars Sinai Medical Center were collected from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified and diagnosed 192 patients by our in-house qPCR assay. In this population, the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'UTR, AA193 protein, RdRp and the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified. Notably, significant viral genomic diversity was identified. Less than 10 percent of the Los Angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, while >50 percent of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from New York State. Based on these findings we conclude SARS-CoV-2 was likely introduced into the Los Angeles community predominantly from New York State but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to Washington State and China.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Department of Pathology and

following COVID-19 infection across three settings (long-term care homes (LTCH), shelters, the rest of the population) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. Methods: We sourced person-level data from COVID-19 surveillance and reporting systems in Ontario, and examined settings with population-specific denominators (LTCH residents, shelters, and the rest of the population). We calculated cumulatively, the diagnosed cases per capita, proportion tested for COVID-19, daily and cumulative positivity, and case fatality proportion. We estimated the age- and sex-adjusted relative rate ratios for test positivity and case fatality using quasi-Poisson regression. Results: Between 01\/23\/2020-05\/25\/2020, we observed a shift in the proportion of cases: from travel-related and into LTCH and shelters. Cumulatively, compared to the rest of the population, the number of diagnosed cases per 100,000 was 59-fold and 18-fold higher among LTCH and shelter residents, respectively. By 05\/25\/2020, 77.2% of LTCH residents compared to 2.4% of the rest of the population had been tested. After adjusting for age and sex, LTCH residents were 2.5 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3-2.8) more likely to test positive. Case fatality was 26.3% (915\/3485), 0.7% (3\/402), and 3.6% (506\/14133) among LTCH residents, shelter population, and others in the GTA, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, case fatality was 1.4-fold (95%CI: 1.1-1.9) higher among LTCH residents than the rest of the population. Interpretation: Heterogeneity across micro-epidemics among specific populations in specific settings may reflect underlying heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linwei Wang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Huiting Ma","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kristy C.Y.

We sought to determine the association between population density and R0 of SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. counties, and whether population density could be used as a proxy for contact rates. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0. We also assessed whether this association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation-to-work percentage. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. The effect of population density and R0 was not modified by private transportation use. Differential R0 by population density can assist in more accurate predictions of the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in areas that do not yet have active cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karla Therese L.

Considerable attention has been paid to the burden COVID-19 has put on acute care hospitals, with numerous models projecting hospitalizations and ICU needs for the duration of the pandemic. However, less attention has been paid to where these patients may go if they require additional care following hospital discharge. As COVID-19 patients recover from severe infections, many of them require additional care. Yet with post-acute care facilities averaging 85\\% capacity prior to the pandemic and the significant potential for outbreaks, consideration of the downstream effects of the surge of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical. Here, we present a method for projecting COVID-19 post-acute care needs. Our model is designed to take the output from any of the numerous epidemiological models (hospital discharges) and estimate the flow of patients to post-acute care services, thus providing a similar surge planning model for post-acute care services. Using data from the University of Utah Hospital, we find that for those who require specialized post-acute care, the majority require either home health care or skilled nursing facilities. Likewise, we find the expected peak in post-acute care occurs about two weeks after the expected peak for acute care hospitalizations, a result of the duration of hospitalization. This short delay between acute care and post-acute care surges highlights the importance of considering the organization necessary to accommodate the influx of recovering COVID patients and protect non-COVID patients prior to the peak in acute care hospitalizations. We developed this model to guide policymakers in addressing the \"aftershocks\" of discharged patients requiring further supportive care; while we only show the outcomes for discharges based on preliminary data from the University of Utah Hospital, we suggest alternative uses for our model including adapting it to explore potential alternative strategies for addressing the surge in acute care facilities during future pandemic waves.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Maloney","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ryan Morley","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Robert Checketts","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Peter Weir","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Darryl Barfuss","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Hannah R Meredith","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle G Hofmann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Samore","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130013","rel_title":"Impacts of regional climate on the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130013","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic had led to 500000 confirmed death by June 30, 2020.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is increased by ARB\/ACEI treatment, as a cell entry receptor. Therefore, the use of ARBs\/ACEIs for COVID-19 remains controversial. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with hypertension before COVID-19 onset. The primary outcome was severe infection or all-cause mortality. Cases included ARB\/ACEI use for 30 days or longer during the 6 months before COVID-19 onset. Primary controls included antihypertensive use other than ARBs\/ACEIs (narrow control); secondary controls included all other hypertension patients (broad control). We investigated ARB\/ACEI association with outcomes in general and by subgroups (age, sex, and presence of diabetes) using logistic regression models with propensity score matching. Findings: Of 234427 suspected COVID-19 patients we screened, 1585 hypertension patients were analyzed. In the 892 cases, 428 narrow controls, and 693 broad controls, severe infection or death occurred in 8.6%, 22.2%, and 16.7%, respectively. ARB\/ACEI use was associated with a reduced risk of severe infection or death relative to the narrow control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.65) and broad control group (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.71). The association was smaller for newly diagnosed hypertension patients (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.42 compared to narrow control group). ARB\/ACEI protective effects against severe infection or death were significantly observed in male and diabetic patients. Interpretation: ARB\/ACEI use was associated with a lower risk of severe infection or mortality compared to other antihypertensives or ARB\/ACEI nonuse.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hee Kyung Choi","author_inst":"Yonsei University; Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hee-Jo Koo","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Hyeri Seok","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Jeon","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Won Suk Choi","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dae Jung Kim","author_inst":"Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dae Won Park","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Euna Han","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129791","rel_title":"Dynamics of psychological responses to Covid-19 in India: A longitudinal study","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129791","rel_abs":"To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, India announced a nationwide lockdown on 24th March 2020 for 21 days, later extended for a longer time. This long period of lockdown greatly disrupted routine life and likely affecting citizens psychological well-being. The psychological toll of the pandemic on Indians is documented. However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention. Sustainable change requires addressing the root causes driving the gender inequalities in psychological distress during such crises.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anvita Gopal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Anupam Joya Sharma","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Malavika Ambale Subramanyam","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Jeon","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Won Suk Choi","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dae Jung Kim","author_inst":"Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dae Won Park","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Euna Han","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
