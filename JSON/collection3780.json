This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidence-based to ensure patient safety.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":null,"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136788","rel_title":"Does Biological Therapy Protect against Severe COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136788","rel_abs":"Objective. To estimate COVID-19 infection incidence rate with severe affectation (requiring hospitalization) in patients with biological treatment due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriasis (Ps), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare it with incidence rate in the general population. Methods: Retrospective observational study based on information provided by two administrative databases. One of these two databases contains information on all patients seen in our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March 4th 2020 and April 26th 2020. The other database contains data from patients seen at Rheumatology, Dermatology and Digestive Departments in our hospital who are currently receiving biological therapy. We calculated the crude and age and sex adjusted incidence in both groups. To compare both groups we calculated the Incidence Rate Ratio. Results: There was a total of 2,182 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Four patients out of a total of 797 patients receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID-19 and required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 1.41%, and it was 0.50% among the group receiving biological therapy. Rates adjusted by age and sex in the biological group was 0.45% (CI95% 0.11-4.13). The IRR of the group receiving biological therapy compared to the general population was 0.39 (CI95% 0.14-1, p=0.049). Conclusion: Findings suggest that prior use of biological therapy does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID-19, and it is likely to have a protective effect against them when compared to the general population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramon Mazzucchelli","author_inst":"Rheumatology Unit.

In this meta-analysis, we studied the prevalence of cancer among patients with COVID-19 infection and their risks of severe events. Methods We searched the Pubmed, Embase and MedRxiv databases for studies between December 2019 and May 3, 2020 using the following key words and terms: sars-cov-2, covid-19, 2019-ncov, 2019 novel coronavirus, corona virus disease-2019, clinical, clinical characteristics, clinical course, epidemiologic features, epidemiology, and epidemiological characteristics. We extracted data following PICO (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) chart. Statistical analyses were performed with R Studio (version 3.5.1) on the group-level data. We assessed the studies risk of bias in accordance to the adjusted Joanna Briggs Institute. We estimated the prevalence or risks for severe events including admission into intensive care unit or death using meta-analysis with random effects. Findings Out of the 2,551 studies identified, 32 studies comprising 21,248 participants have confirmed COVID-19. The total prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 3.97% (95% CI, 3.08% to 5.12%), higher than that of the total cancer rate (0.29%) in China. Stratification analysis showed that the overall cancer prevalence of COVID-19 patients in China was 2.59% (95% CI, 1.72% to 3.90%), and the prevalence reached 3.79% in Wuhan (95% CI, 2.51% to 5.70%) and 2.31% (95% CI, 1.16% to 4.57%) in other areas outside Wuhan in China. The incidence of ICU admission in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 26.80% (95% CI, 21.65% to 32.67%) and the mortality was 24.32% (95% CI, 13.95% to 38.91%), much higher than the overall rates of COVID-19 patients in China. The fatality in COVID patients with cancer was lower than those with cardiovascular disease (OR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.71; p=0.39), but comparable with other comorbidities such as diabetes (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.42 to 4.11; p=0.19), hypertension (OR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.35 to 4.62; p=0.13), and respiratory diseases (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.33; p=0.45). Interpretation This comprehensive meta-analysis on the largest number of patients to date provides solid evidence that COVID-19 infection significantly and negatively affected the disease course and prognosis of cancer patients. Awareness of this could help guide clinicians and health policy makers in combating cancer in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Su","author_inst":"Department of Oncology,Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-xuan Hu","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hai-shan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Emily C Zhu","author_inst":"McCoy College of Business, Texas State University, 601 University Dr."},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Speculations have circulated that exposure to major epidemics helped health systems respond more quickly to COVID-19. This study leverages organizational memory theory to test whether health systems with any, more severe, more recent exposure to major epidemics enacted timelier COVID-19 policy responses. Methods: A dataset was constructed cataloguing 846 policies across 178 health systems in total, 37 of which had major epidemics within the last twenty years. Hypothesis testing used OLS regressions with WHO region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. Results: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was significantly associated with providing earlier response in any category or for surveillance \/ response, distancing, and international travel policies when tested alone or with total number of cases. The effect was about six to ten days earlier response. The significance was largely nullified with additional independent variables. Both total cases and years since previous epidemics showed no statistical significance. Conclusion: This study suggests that health systems may learn from past major epidemics. Policymakers ought to institutionalize lessons from COVID-19. Future studies can examine specific generalizable lessons and whether timelier responses correlated with lower health and economic impacts.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sian Hsiang-Te Tsuei","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jie-xuan Hu","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hai-shan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Emily C Zhu","author_inst":"McCoy College of Business, Texas State University, 601 University Dr."},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing and lockdown in a city, as well as the effect of protective gears or practices. The chance of travelling to another city and within the city during lockdown, and initial percentage of exposed and infected individuals on both cities influence the increase in the number of newly-infected individuals on both models. Our simulations show that (i) increase in exposed individuals results in increase in number of new infections, hence the need for increased testing-isolation efforts; (ii) protection level of 75-100% effectiveness impedes disease transmission; (iii) travelling within city or to other city can be an option given that strict preventive measures (e.g., non-pharmaceutical interventions) are observed; and (iv) the ideal set-up for neighboring cities is to implement lockdown when there is high risk of disease local transmission while individuals observe social distancing, maximizing protective measures, and isolating those that are exposed. The results of the agent-based and compartmental models show similar qualitative dynamics; the differences are due to different spatio-temporal heterogeneity and stochasticity. These models can aid decision makers in designing infectious disease-related policies to protect individuals while continuing population movement.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Destiny SM Lutero","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Yancee H Olave","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Monica C Torres","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar F Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

A comprehensive review on this topic is important to highlight the areas for improvement and interventions to prevent COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to summarize the level of KAP about COVID-19 via a systematic review Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using a combination of selected keywords in four scientific databases to identify relevant literature published from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Nineteen articles were included in the systematic review, and sixteen studies in the meta-analysis. The data was analyzed using a random-effects model due to the heterogeneity between the studies. Results: Lack of COVID-19-related knowledge, positive perceptions, and preventive practices were detected and seems widespread. In particular, 56.6% (95%CI: 45.9-67%) of the health care workers (HCWs) and medical students had poor knowledge about COVID-19 and only 46% (95%CI: 15-77) of the total study sample had positive perceptions towards COVID-19. Besides, 81.7% of the sample prioritized practicing hand hygiene to prevent COVID-19, but wearing a face mask to prevent COVID-19 transmission was suboptimal (73.4%). Finally, around eighty percent of the subjects had good knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms (79%) and its transmission (82%) and reported that they avoided crowded places to prevent getting COVID-19 (89%). Conclusion: Evidence-based practices on risk communication and raising awareness should be planned by local governments in collaboration with healthcare organizations. Specifically, educational initiatives for HCWs to prioritize wearing a face mask and practicing hand hygiene should be considered a priority.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshaya Srikanth Bhagavathula","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Wafa Ali Aldhaleei","author_inst":"Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City"},{"author_name":"Jamal Rahmani","author_inst":"Department of Community Nutrition, Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Khubchandani","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition and Health Science, College of Health, Ball State University, Indiana, USA"},{"author_name":"Jomar F Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

In anticipation that the recurrence of outbreaks and the measures for lifting the lockdown worldwide may cause supply chain issues over the coming months, we assessed the sensitivity of a number of one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) solutions to detect SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We evaluated six different RT-qPCR alternatives for SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 diagnosis based on standard RNA extractions. That of best sensitivity was also assessed with direct nasopharyngeal swab viral transmission medium (VTM) heating, overcoming the RNA extraction step. Results: We found a wide variability in the sensitivity of RT-qPCR solutions that associated with a range of false negatives from as low as 2% (0.3-7.9%) to as much as 39.8% (30.2-50.2). Direct preheating of VTM combined with the best solution provided a sensitivity of 72.5% (62.5-81.0), in the range of some of the solutions based on standard RNA extractions. Conclusions: We evidenced sensitivity limitations of currently used RT-qPCR solutions. Our results will help to calibrate the impact of false negative diagnoses of COVID-19, and to detect and control new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and community transmissions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Alcoba-Florez","author_inst":"Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital Universitario N.

Objectives: To explore the associations of air pollutants and meteorological factors with COVID-19 confirmed cases across 31 Chinese provinces during the outbreak period. Methods: The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors in 31 Chinese provinces from January 25 to February 29, 2020 were extracted from authoritative electronic databases. The associations were estimated for a single-day lag (lag0-lag6) as well as moving averages lag (lag01-lag05) using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), adjusted for time trends, day of the week, holidays and meteorological variables. Region-specific analyses and meta-analysis were conducted in five selected regions with diverse air pollution levels and weather conditions. Nonlinear exposure-response analyses were performed. Results: We examined 77,578 COVID-19 confirmed cases across 31 Chinese provinces during the study period. An increase of each interquartile range in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3 and CO at lag4 corresponded to 1.40 (1.37-1.43), 1.35 (1.32-1.37), 1.01 (1.00-1.02), 1.08 (1.07-1.10), 1.28 (1.27-1.29) and 1.26 (1.24-1.28) odds ratios (ORs) of daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases, respectively. For 1 oc, 1% and 1 m\/s increase in temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity, the ORs were 0.97 (0.97-0.98), 0.96 (0.96-0.97), and 0.94 (0.92-0.95), respectively. The estimates of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and all meteorological factors remained statistically significant after meta-analysis for the five selected regions. The exposure-response relationships showed that higher concentrations of air pollutants and lower meteorological factors were associated with daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases increasing. Conclusions: Higher air pollutant concentrations and lower temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity may favor COVID-19 transmission. As summer months are arriving in the Northern Hemisphere, the environmental factors and implementation of public health control measures may play an optimistic role in controlling COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Han Cao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Bingxiao Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Customer Advisory, SAS institute, Inc., Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Kai Meng","author_inst":"Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Ling ZHANG","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Carlos Flores","author_inst":"Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.S. de Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Despite the strict lockdown measures in several developing countries, the number of newly infected cases is getting unbridled as time progresses. This anomaly ignites questions about the effectiveness of the prolonged strict confinement measures. In light of the above view, with an aim to find the answer to this question, trends of four epidemiological parameters: growth factor of daily reported COVID-19 cases, daily incidence proportion, daily cumulative index and effective reproduction number in five developing countries named Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa have been analysed meticulously considering the different phases of their national lockdowns. Any compelling evidence has not been found in favor of country-wide lockdown effectiveness in the above-mentioned countries. Numerical results illustrate that stringent nationwide lockdown measures have failed bringing the epidemic threshold (Re) of COVID-19 under unity. In addition, citizens of the aforementioned countries have been struggling with catastrophic socio-economic consequences due to prolonged confinement measures. Our study suggests that a new policy should be proposed for developing countries to battle against future disease outbreaks ensuring a perfect balance between saving lives and confirming livelihoods.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khondoker Nazmoon Nabi","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Islam Md.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Methods Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. Results The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24% Conclusions While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clement de Chaisemartin","author_inst":"UC Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Luc de Chaisemartin","author_inst":"Immunology Department, APHP Nord-Universite de Paris, Bichat Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Customer Advisory, SAS institute, Inc., Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Kai Meng","author_inst":"Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Ling ZHANG","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Carlos Flores","author_inst":"Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.S. de Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Here we present a rapid, robust, highly sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay. Our forty-minute procedure bypasses a dedicated RNA isolation step, is insensitive to carry-over contamination, and uses a hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)-based colorimetric readout, which allows robust SARS-CoV-2 detection from various sample types. Based on this assay we have substantially increased sensitivity and scalability by a simple nucleic acid enrichment step (bead-LAMP), established a pipette-free version for home testing (HomeDip-LAMP), and developed a version with open source enzymes that could be produced in any molecular biology setting. Our advanced, universally applicable RT-LAMP assay is a major step towards population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max J Kellner","author_inst":"IMP, IMBA and LMB"},{"author_name":"James J Ross","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jakob Schnabl","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Marcus P.S.

There is a hyperinflammatory response involved in the clinical course of patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV2. To date, there has been no definite therapy for COVID-19. We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. Methods: We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. Results: CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg\/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days. None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation. Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care. Conclusions: A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes. This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, patients positive response to short-term corticosteroids demonstrates that they may help blunt the severity of inflammation and prevent a severe hyperinflammatory phase, in turn reducing the length of stay, ICU admissions, and healthcare costs.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vijairam Selvaraj","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwame Dapaah-Afriyie","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arkadiy Finn","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Timothy Flanigan","author_inst":"Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University"},{"author_name":"Robert Heinen","author_inst":"IMP, IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Irina Grishkovskaya","author_inst":"IMP"},{"author_name":"Benedikt Bauer","author_inst":"IMP"},{"author_name":"Johannes Stadlmann","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna"},{"author_name":"Luis Menendez-Arias","author_inst":"Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Spain"},{"author_name":"Robert Fritsche-Polanz","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Marianna Traugott","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Tamara Seitz","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, 1100 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, 1100 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Manuela Foedinger","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, Klinik Favoriten; Sigmund Freud Private University, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Christoph Wenisch","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Johannes Zuber","author_inst":"IMP, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"- Vienna Covid-19 Diagnostics Initiative (VCDI)","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pauli","author_inst":"IMP, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Julius Brennecke","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20117747","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater foreshadow dynamics and clinical presentation of new COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20117747","rel_abs":"Current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence are largely based on symptomatic, clinically diagnosed cases. The existence of a large number of undiagnosed infections hampers population-wide investigation of viral circulation. Here, we use longitudinal wastewater analysis to track SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in wastewater at a major urban wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts, between early January and May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in wastewater on March 3. Viral titers in wastewater increased exponentially from mid-March to mid-April, after which they began to decline. Viral titers in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 4-10 days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. We inferred viral shedding dynamics by modeling wastewater viral titers as a convolution of back-dated new clinical cases with the viral shedding function of an individual. The inferred viral shedding function showed an early peak, likely before symptom onset and clinical diagnosis, consistent with emerging clinical and experimental evidence. Finally, we found that wastewater viral titers at the neighborhood level correlate better with demographic variables than with population size. This work suggests that longitudinal wastewater analysis can be used to identify trends in disease transmission in advance of clinical case reporting, and may shed light on infection characteristics that are difficult to capture in clinical investigations, such as early viral shedding dynamics.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fuqing Wu","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Amy Xiao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Katya Moniz","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Noriko Endo","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Federica Armas","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard Bonneau","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Megan A Brown","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Mary Bushman","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Peter R Chai","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Timothy B Erickson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Foppe","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiong Gu","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"William P Hanage","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Huang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mariana Matus","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle A McElroy","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jonathan Nagler","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Steven F Rhode","author_inst":"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Tucker","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Shijie Zhao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric J Alm","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20132910","rel_title":"Insufficient social distancing may be related to a future COVID-19 outbreak in Ijui-Brazil: Predictions of further social interventions.","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20132910","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease initiated in 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be highly contagious and quickly became a pandemic.

Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routine (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijui, and the mobile social distancing index (MSDI) was also registered. In this study, we demonstrate the decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijui. Also, we provide predictions for cases, hospitalization, and deaths in the city. We concluded that the insufficient social distancing, evidenced by different methods, might have a strong relationship with the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijui.

Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate a potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers as well as the ability to predict mortality from two different lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS). We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged >70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. The correlation between biochemical parameters and either LUSS score was significant for ferritin levels. It was 0.486 (p=0.001) for LUSS8 and 0.458 (p=0.002) for LUSS12. Using a threshold score of 15 with LUSS12 predicted mortality in 86.7% of cases (ORcrude 31, CI 95% 4.79-200.51). Applying a threshold of 10 with LUSS8 predicted mortality in 88.9% (ORcrude 69.75, CI 95% 6.90-705.20). There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS. The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurelio Luis Wanguemert Perez","author_inst":"Pneumology Service, San Juan de Dios Hospital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Marco Figueira Goncalvez","author_inst":"Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery Service, University Hospital Nuestra Senora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Hernandez Perez","author_inst":"Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery Service, University Hospital Nuestra Senora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Ramallo Farina","author_inst":"Foundation of the Canary Islands Health Research Institute (FIISC), Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.

Given the effects of COVID-19 in pulmonary tissues, chest radiography imaging plays an important role for the screening, early detection and monitoring of the suspected individuals. Hence, as the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, there will be a greater reliance on the use of portable equipment for the acquisition of chest X-Ray images due to its accessibility, widespread availability and benefits regarding to infection control issues, minimizing the risk of cross contamination. This work presents novel fully automatic approaches specifically tailored for the classification of chest X-Ray images acquired by portable equipment into 3 different clinical categories: normal, pathological and COVID-19. For this purpose, two complementary deep learning approaches based on a densely convolutional network architecture are herein presented. The joint response of both approaches allows to enhance the differentiation between patients infected with COVID-19, patients with other diseases that manifest characteristics similar to COVID-19 and normal cases. The proposed approaches were validated over a dataset provided by the Radiology Service of the Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru&ntildea (CHUAC) specifically retrieved for this research. Despite the poor quality of chest X-Ray images that is inherent to the nature of the portable equipment, the proposed approaches provided satisfactory results, allowing a reliable analysis of portable radiographs, to support the clinical decision-making process.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquim de Moura","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Lucia Ramos","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Placido L.

Opaganib is a selective sphingosine-kinase (SK)-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. Methods. We provided opaganib on a compassionate-use basis to patients with severe COVID-19. Patients who required oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were offered the treatment. For comparison, we used a control group with same-sex, same-severity patients. Results. Seven patients received at least one dose of opaganib since April 2, 2020. One patient, who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, developed diarrhea and all his medications were stopped. This was the only adverse effect possibly related to opaganib. A second patient was weaned of oxygen and discharged after receiving two doses of opaganib. Therefore, five patients were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls. Patients treated with opaganib had significantly faster increase in lymphocyte count. All other clinical outcomes had a non-statistically significant trend in favor of the treatment group: median time to weaning from HFNC was 10 and 15 days in cases vs. controls (HR= 0.3, 95% CI: 0.07-1.7, p=0.2) ,time to ambient air was 13 vs.14.5 days (HR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.15-1.5), none of the cases required mechanical ventilation compared with 33% of controls. Conclusion. In this small cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, opaganib was safe and well tolerated with improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters in all treated patients. The efficacy of opaganib for COVID-19 infection should be further tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramzi Kurd","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical center"},{"author_name":"Eli Ben-Chetrit","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Karameh","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maskit Bar-Meir","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical center"},{"author_name":"Laura Abelairas","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna (CHUAC)"},{"author_name":"Eva Castro","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna (CHUAC)"},{"author_name":"Jorge Novo","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Marcos Ortega","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Evelise Moraes Berlezi","author_inst":"Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (Uniju\u00ed)"},{"author_name":"Peter R Chai","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Timothy B Erickson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Foppe","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiong Gu","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"William P Hanage","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Huang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mariana Matus","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle A McElroy","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jonathan Nagler","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Steven F Rhode","author_inst":"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Tucker","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Shijie Zhao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric J Alm","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20131573","rel_title":"Organisms causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 patients at 5 UK ICUs as detected with the FilmArray test","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20131573","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Introduction. Several viral respiratory infections - notably influenza - are associated with secondary bacterial infection and additional pathology. The extent to which this applies for COVID-19 is unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to define the bacteria causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 ICU patients using the FilmArray Pneumonia Panel, and to determine this tests potential in COVID-19 management. Methods. COVID-19 ICU patients with clinically-suspected secondary infection at 5 UK hospitals were tested with the FilmArray at point of care. We collected patient demographic data and compared FilmArray results with routine culture. Results. We report results of 110 FilmArray tests on 94 patients (16 had 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) were male, the median age was 59 yrs; 92 were ventilated. Median hospital stay before testing was 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests were positive, with 141 bacteria detected. Most were Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) or Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), as is typical of hospital and ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), were rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus\/Enterovirus) and no atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) were positive by routine culture, and fewer species were reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained the most prevalent pathogens. Conclusion. FilmArray had a higher diagnostic yield than culture for ICU COVID-19 patients with suspected secondary pneumonias. The bacteria found mostly were Enterobacterales, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as in typical HAP\/VAP, but with Klebsiella spp. more prominent. We found almost no viral co-infection. Turnaround from sample to results is around 1h 15 min compared with the usual 72h for culture, giving prescribers earlier data to inform antimicrobial decisions.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zaneeta Dhesi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Virve I Enne","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"David Brealey","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David M Livermore","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Juliet High","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Russell","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Antony Colles","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Hala Kandil","author_inst":"Watford General Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Damien Mack","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Martin","author_inst":"Peninsula Medical School, University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Valerie Page","author_inst":"Watford General Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Parker","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerry Roulston","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suveer Singh","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Wey","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ann Marie Swart","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Susan Stirling","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Julie A Barber","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park"},{"author_name":"Vanya A Gant","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Nagler","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Steven F Rhode","author_inst":"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Tucker","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Shijie Zhao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric J Alm","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20132944","rel_title":"Clinical predictors of donor antibody titer and correlation with recipient antibody response in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20132944","rel_abs":"Background: Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results: Mean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9 and 7.8% (8\/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3% (p=0.02). Conclusion: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Lucia L Madariaga","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jenna Guthmiller","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Stephen Schrantz","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maud Jansen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chancey Christenson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Madan Kumar","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Micah Prochaska","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136580","rel_title":"Estimation of Undetected Symptomatic and Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 Infection and prediction of its spread in USA","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136580","rel_abs":"The reported COVID-19 cases in the USA have crossed over 2 million, and a large number of infected cases are undetected whose estimation can be done if country-wide antibody testing is performed. In this work, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by modeling and simulation approach. We propose a new epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers Symptomatic, Purely Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the lockdown conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of total number of confirmed, active and death, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study also demonstrates the possibility of a second wave of the infection if social distancing regulations are relaxed to a large extent. We estimate that around 12.7 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 17.7 million (range: 16.3-19.2) people, or 5.3% (range: 4.9-5.8) of the population will be infected by when the disease spread ends in the USA. We find the Infection to Fatality Ratio to be 0.93% (range: 0.85-1.01).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashutosh Mahajan","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Solanki","author_inst":"Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India"},{"author_name":"Namitha Sivadas","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Maud Jansen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chancey Christenson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Madan Kumar","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Micah Prochaska","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136341","rel_title":"Analysis and Prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136341","rel_abs":"In this study, we estimate the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan prior to and after lockdown restrictions were eased.

We use a deterministic epidemic model that includes asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated, and medicated population compartments for our analysis. We calculate the basic reproduction number R0 for the pre and post lockdown periods, noting that during this time, no medication was available. The pre-lock down the value of R0 is estimated to be 1.07, and the post lockdown value is estimated to be 1.86. We use this analysis to project the epidemic curve for a variety of lockdown, social distancing, and medication scenarios. We note that if no substantial efforts are made to contain the epidemic, it will peak in mid of September, with the maximum projected active cases being close to 700,000. In a realistic, best-case scenario, we project that the epidemic peaks in early to mid-July with the maximum active cases being around 120000.We note that social distancing measures and medication, if available, will help flatten the curve, however without the reintroduction of further lockdown, it would be very difficult to bring R0 below 1. Our study strongly supports the recent WHO recommendation of reintroducing lockdowns to control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohsin Ali","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science & Technology, Mishref, Kuwait;"},{"author_name":"Adnan Khan","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Maud Jansen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chancey Christenson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Madan Kumar","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Micah Prochaska","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136606","rel_title":"Extension and implementation of a system modelling the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136606","rel_abs":"We modelling the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic taking into account the role of the unreported cases.

Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures. Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic. Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters. Conclusion: Lockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lia Mayorga","author_inst":"IHEM"},{"author_name":"Clara Garcia","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Flores","author_inst":"Eventbrite"},{"author_name":"Sofia Masuelli","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Maria Victoria Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina y Biologia Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU), Centro Cientifico y Tecnologico de Mendoza (CCT-Mendoza), CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.20.20136382","rel_title":"Behavioral changes before lockdown, and decreased retail and recreation mobility during lockdown, contributed most to the successful control of the COVID-19 epidemic in 35 Western countries","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.20.20136382","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koen Deforche","author_inst":"Emweb bv"},{"author_name":"Jurgen Vercauteren","author_inst":"KULeuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Institute for "},{"author_name":"Viktor M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Insitute of Biology, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Anne-Mieke Vandamme","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Institute for"},{"author_name":"Maria Victoria Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina y Biologia Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU), Centro Cientifico y Tecnologico de Mendoza (CCT-Mendoza), CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136705","rel_title":"Healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and views about support during COVID-19 and comparable pandemics: A rapid review and meta-synthesis","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136705","rel_abs":"Healthcare workers across the world have risen to the demands of treating COVID-19 patients, potentially at significant cost to their own health and wellbeing.

However, little attention has so far been paid to understanding the impact of working on a pandemic from healthcare workers own perspectives or what their views are about support. This rapid review identified 40 qualitative studies which have explored healthcare workers experiences and views from previous pandemics, including and comparable to COVID-19. Meta-synthesis of this qualitative data using thematic analysis derived eight key themes which transcended pandemics, time, and geographical boundaries. This pandemic is not unprecedented; the themes that arose from previous pandemics were remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of COVID-19 globally today. We have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of these previous pandemics, mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce worldwide.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo Billings","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Brian Chi Fung Ching","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Gkofa","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Talya Greene","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Bloomfield","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136598","rel_title":"Chest X-ray classification using Deep learning for automated COVID-19 screening","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136598","rel_abs":"In today's world, we find ourselves struggling to fight one of the worst pandemics in the history of humanity known as COVID-2019 caused by a coronavirus. If we detect the virus at an early stage (before it enters the lower respiratory tract), the patient can be treated quickly. Once the virus reaches the lungs, we observe ground-glass opacity in the chest X-ray due to fibrosis in the lungs. Due to the significant differences between X-ray images of an infected and non-infected person, artificial intelligence techniques can be used to identify the presence and severity of the infection. We propose a classification model that can analyze the chest X-rays and help in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Our methodology classifies the chest X-rays into 4 classes viz. normal, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. Further, the X-rays indicating COVID-19 are classified on severity-basis into mild, medium, and severe. The deep learning model used for the classification of pneumonia, TB, and normal is VGG16 with an accuracy of 95.9 %. For the segregation of normal pneumonia and COVID-19, the DenseNet-161 was used with an accuracy of 98.9 %. ResNet-18 worked best for severity classification achieving accuracy up to 76 %.
