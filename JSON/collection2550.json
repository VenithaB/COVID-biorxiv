Recent studies have shown that masks have been effective in several countries and populations, leaving only a lack of quantitative data on the control of airborne dispersion from human exhalation. This current study specifically has the objective to quantify the effectiveness of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings in controlling airborne dispersion from exhalation (both droplet and aerosol) by measuring changes in direction, particle cloud velocities, and concentration. Design: This randomized effectiveness study used a 10% NaCl nebulized polydisperse particle solution (0.3 um up to 10 um in size) delivered by an exhalation simulator to conduct 94 experiment runs with combinations of 8 different fabrics, 5 mask designs, and airflows for both talking and coughing. Multiple particle sensors were instrumented to measure reduction in aerosol dispersion. Results: Three-way multivariate analysis of variance establishes that fabric, mask design, and exhalation breath level have a statistically significant effect on changing direction, reducing velocity, or concentrations of airborne particles (Fabric: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Mask design: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Breath level: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .004). There were also statistically significant interaction effects between combinations of all primary factors. Conclusions and Relevance: The application of facial coverings or masks can significantly reduce the airborne dispersion of aerosolized particles from exhalation by diffusing the particle cloud direction and slow down its travel speed. Consequently, the results indicate that wearing masks when coupled with social distance can decrease the potentially inhaled dose of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols or droplets especially where infectious contaminants may exist in shared air spaces. The conclusion is well aligned with the concept of \"time-distance-shielding\" from hazardous materials emergency response. However, the effectiveness varies greatly between the specific fabrics and mask designs used.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan J Edwards","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Widrick","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Richard Potember","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Mike Gerschefske","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20149344","rel_title":"Placental SARS-CoV-2 in a patient with mild COVID-19 disease","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20149344","rel_abs":"Background: The full impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy remains uncharacterized. Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality,1 and COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women.2 We present a case of placental SARS-CoV-2 virus in a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy and mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A pregnant woman was evaluated at University of Missouri Women and Childrens Hospital. Institutional review board approval was obtained; information was obtained from medical records. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. A gynecological pathologist examined the placenta and performed histolopathology. Sections were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; slides were cut and subjected to hematoxylin-and-eosin or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. IHC was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. Findings: A 29 year-old multigravida presented at 40-4\/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias two days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her parents were in self-isolation for COVID-19 positivity; husband was asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19, but exposed to a workplace (meatpacking facility) outbreak. Prenatal course was uncomplicated, with no gestational hypertension. She was afebrile and asymptomatic with normal vital signs throughout hospitalization. Her myalgias improved prior to admission. A liveborn male infant was delivered vaginally. Newborn course was uneventful; he was appropriate for gestational age, physical was unremarkable, and he was discharged home at 36 hours. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative at 24 hours. At one-week follow-up, newborn was breastfeeding well, with no fevers or respiratory distress. Overall placental histology is consistent with acute uterine hypoxia (subchorionic laminar necrosis) superimposed on chronic uterine hypoxia (extra-villous trophoblasts and focal chronic villitis). IHC using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens throughout the placenta in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and rarely in CK7-expressing trophoblasts. Negative control placenta (November 2019 delivery) and ferret nasal turbinate tissues (not shown) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: In this report, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the placenta, but newborn was COVID-19 negative. Our case shows maternal vascular malperfusion, with no features of fetal vascular malperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental COVID-19 despite mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy (with no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); specifically, this patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her having mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for possible placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and other pregnancy complications) as well as for potential vertical transmission -- especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed, to determine whether women with mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic COVID-19 may have SARS-CoV-2 virus that can cross the placenta, cause fetal vascular malperfusion, and possibly affect the fetus. This raises important public health and public policy questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing on a regular basis throughout pregnancy.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert L.

Design This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from 2003 until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.

Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [&ge;] 7911 tests\/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [&ge;] 10028 tests\/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [&ge;] 4540 tests\/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150\/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

However, most studies thus far are based on hospitalized patients and lack longitudinal follow up. As the majority of COVID-19 cases are not hospitalized, prospective studies of symptoms in the population presenting to primary care are needed. Here, we assess the longitudinal dynamic of clinical symptoms in non-hospitalized individuals prior to and throughout the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Data on symptoms were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) consisting of both results of PCR tests and symptoms recorded by primary care physicians, and linked longitudinal self reported symptoms. Setting The second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel , Maccabi Health Services Participants From 1\/3\/2020 to 07\/06\/2020, information on symptoms from either surveys or primary care visits was available for 206,377 individuals, including 2,471 who tested positive for COVID-19. Main Outcomes Longitudinal prevalence of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 infection diagnosed by PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: In adults, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in EHR were cough (11.6%), fever (10.3%), and myalgia (7.7%) and the most prevalent self-reported symptoms were cough (21%), fatigue (19%) and rhinorrhea and\/or nasal congestion (17%). In children, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in the EHR were fever (7%), cough (5.5%) and abdominal pain (2.4%) . Emotional disturbances were documented in 15.9% of the positive adults and 4.2% of the children. Loss of taste and smell, either self-reported or documented by a physician, 3 weeks prior to testing, were the most discriminative symptoms in adults (OR =11.18 and OR=5.47 respectively). Additional symptoms included self reported headache (OR = 2.03) and fatigue (OR = 1.73) and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea (OR = 2.09 for both ) and fever (OR= 1.62 ) by a physician. Mean time to recovery was 23.5 +- 9.9 days. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration (21.7 +- 8.8 days, p-value=0.01). Several symptoms, including fatigue, myalgia, runny nose and shortness of breath were reported weeks after recovery. Conclusions As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly worldwide, obtaining accurate information on symptoms and their progression is of essence. Our study shed light on the full clinical spectrum of symptoms experienced by infected individuals in primary care, and may alert physicians for the possibility of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Barak Mizrahi","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Hagai Rossman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nir Kalkstein","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20151860","rel_title":"Implied susceptible population size: modelling and projecting Covid19 dynamics via the SIR equations","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20151860","rel_abs":"The SIR differential equations in Epidemiology are re-examined in the context of Covid19, 2020.

Hundreds of COVID-19 models have been released. Decision-makers need information about the predictive performance of these models to help select which ones should be used to guide decision-making. Methods: We identified 383 published or publicly released COVID-19 forecasting models. Only seven models met the inclusion criteria of: estimating for five or more countries, providing regular updates, forecasting at least 4 weeks from the model release date, estimating mortality, and providing date-versioned sets of previously estimated forecasts. These models included those produced by: DELPHI-MIT (Delphi), Youyang Gu (YYG), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Imperial College London (Imperial), and three models produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). For each of these models, we examined the median absolute percent error-compared to subsequently observed trends-for weekly and cumulative death forecasts. Errors were stratified by weeks of extrapolation, world region, and month of model estimation. For locations with epidemics showing a clear peak, each model's accuracy was also evaluated in predicting the timing of peak daily mortality. Results: Across models, the median absolute percent error (MAPE) on cumulative deaths for models released in June rose with increased weeks of extrapolation, from 2.3% at one week to 16.3% at six weeks. MAPE at 6 weeks was less than 20% for the IHME-MS-SEIR model (10.2%), YYG (11.1%), LANL (12.6%) and Delphi (19.1%). Across models, MAPE at six weeks were the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (65.3%), and the lowest in high-income countries (8.5%). Median absolute errors (MAE) for peak timing also rose with increased forecasting weeks, from 9 days at one week to 30 days at six weeks. Peak timing MAE at six weeks ranged from 20 days for the IHME Curve Fit model, to 38 days for the LANL model. Interpretation: Four of the models, from IHME, YYG, Delphi and LANL, had less than 20% MAPE at six weeks. Despite the complexities of modelling human behavioural responses and government interventions related to COVID-19, predictions among these better-performing models were surprisingly accurate. Forecasts and alternative scenarios can be a useful input to decision-makers, although users should be aware of increasing errors with a greater amount of extrapolation time, and corresponding steadily widening uncertainty intervals further in the future. The framework and publicly available codebase presented can be routinely used to evaluate the performance of all publicly released models meeting inclusion criteria in the future, and compare current model predictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Friedman","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Patrick Liu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Emmanuela Gakidou","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"- IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Karni Marcus","author_inst":"KI Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yael Barer","author_inst":"Maccabi Institute for Research and Innovation"},{"author_name":"Ayya Keshet","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152637","rel_title":"Modelling suggests blood group incompatibility may substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152637","rel_abs":"Several independent datasets suggest blood type A is over-represented and type O under-represented among COVID-19 patients.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods. We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the reasonable number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. Results. Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease cure time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P * (-0.273 + 0.009I +0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) * (1+V).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinyu Li","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Center of Stomatology, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University,"},{"author_name":"Yufeng Cai","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University,  Changsha, Hunan"},{"author_name":"Yinghe Ding","author_inst":"Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia-da Li","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Huang","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ye Liang","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Center of Stomatology, Xiangya Hospital,  Central South University,"},{"author_name":"Linyong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20152298","rel_title":"The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20152298","rel_abs":"Background: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. Methods: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. Findings: With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). Interpretation: While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy W.

It further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work, then predicts their perceived values, should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon John Childs","author_inst":"University of Fort Hare"},{"author_name":"Joesph Wu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Linyong Xu","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Shamir-Stein","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Anat Ekka Zohar","author_inst":"Quality, Research and Evaluation Administration, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodick","author_inst":"Research and Evaluation Department, Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20100941","rel_title":"Covid-19 and dysregulated cerebral perfusion: observations with multimodal MRI","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20100941","rel_abs":"The pathogenesis of encephalopathy-associated Covid-19 is still unclear.

Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%).

Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate. Results: The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness. Conclusions: High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shufang Sun","author_inst":"Brown University Alpert Medical School"},{"author_name":"Danhua Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Don Operario","author_inst":"Brown University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ziyong Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xionglin Fan","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"theresa Israel","author_inst":"Service de Radiologie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Agathe Raynaud-Simon","author_inst":"Service de Geriatrie, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris, France, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Borie","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat"},{"author_name":"Pierre Amarenco","author_inst":"Service de Neurologie et des Accidents Vasculaires Cerebraux, APHP Nord, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard.INSERM Laboratory for Vascular Translational Science-Unit"},{"author_name":"Antoine Khalil","author_inst":"APHP Nord, Inserm UMR1152, Physiopathology and Epidemiology of Respiratory Diseases, Diderot Paris University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152272","rel_title":"Effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152272","rel_abs":"The retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients suffering from COVID-19 has indicated that statin therapy, used to lower plasma cholesterol levels, is associated with a better clinical outcome.

Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and\/or related mortality. Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Centre for Statistics in M"},{"author_name":"Cristian Tebe","author_inst":"1) Biostatistics Unit at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Spain, 2) Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Universitat Autonoma de Ba"},{"author_name":"Elena Roel","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nina G\u00f6decke","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Martens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Yilmaz","author_inst":"Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Pink","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefan P\u00f6hlmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas F Schulz","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Reinhold F\u00f6rster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20147900","rel_title":"Empirical non-linear modeling & forecast of global daily deaths of COVID-19 pandemic & evidence that a third wave is beginning to decay","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20147900","rel_abs":"Objectives: The present COVID-19 pandemic (C19P) is challenging our socities all over the world. In this work, based on massive health information daily updated, the C19P daily death numbers at a global level, are modelled, analyzed and forecasted.\n\nMethods: Two empirical models are proposed to explain daily death (DD) records: a) self-similar (SS) recurrences of the global responses, and b) geometric averaging of two independent SS models for global DD records.\n\nFindings: The detected self-similar recurrences in the global response suggest three global self-similar waves that support multi-month forecasts of the DD numbers. However, there are upper and lower-limit SS forecast DD scenarios that were jointly integrated with a geometrical average (GA) model, that support the existence of a moderated third wave, with a decaying stage for the next months (July-September 2020). It appears that the third world (South America [SAM]+Asia [ASI] +Africa [AFR]), is the actual big player, (following China, and Europe [EUR]+North America [NAM]) with its biggest contribution to a global third wave (W3) of C19P.\n\nConclusion: The empirical global modeling of the C19P has suggested us a possible moderated W3 scenario, with contributions mainly coming from the third world people. This moderated W3 scenario, after to be calibrated with the last weeks, has provided to stakeholders of significant data and criteria to define, sustain and support plans for the next months, based on data and self-similarities. These scenarios provide a well-based perspective on non-linear dynamics of C19P, that will complement the standard health and economic models.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Sanchez-Sesma","author_inst":"Independent researcher and consultant"},{"author_name":"Cristian Tebe","author_inst":"1) Biostatistics Unit at Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Spain, 2) Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain, 2) Universitat Autonoma de Ba"},{"author_name":"Elena Roel","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"1) Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Talita Duarte-Salles","author_inst":"1) Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nina G\u00f6decke","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Martens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Hannah Kleine-Weber","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Anne Cossmann","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Yilmaz","author_inst":"Public Health Department"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Pink","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Georg MN Behrens","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Stefan P\u00f6hlmann","author_inst":"University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas F Schulz","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"},{"author_name":"Reinhold F\u00f6rster","author_inst":"Hannover Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.199588","rel_title":"Cold sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.199588","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, a primary target for COVID-19 vaccine development, presents two conformations of its Receptor Binding Domain - a receptor-accessible \"up\" conformation, or a receptor-inaccessible \"down\" conformation.

This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping\/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig\/smoking.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abby C.

PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity.

Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1. Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration. Altogether this work uncovered the mechanism that how various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent and replenish alveoli loss post severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zuo","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Zixian Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Yueqing Zhou","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofan Wang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhang","author_inst":"Regend Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Sujit S.

Here we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional landscape. These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus. RNA-Seq profiling implicated the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the underlying mechanism of inhibition and suggested that targeting this aspect of host biology may significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisy A.

The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez-Rom\u00e1n","author_inst":"Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"},{"author_name":"Adrian J Gibbs","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Megan L.

This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. However, currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and\/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We proposed an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Thus, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the global temporal and geographic haplotypes distribution in the world. Using 48 776 genomes, we identify 5 major haplotypes based on 9 high-frequency mutations. Normalized global geographic and temporal analysis is presented here highlighting the current importance of nucleocapsid mutations (R203K, G204R) above the highly discussed D614G in spike protein. Also, we analyzed age, gender, and patient status distribution by haplotypes, but scarce and not well-organized information about this is publicly available. For that, we create a web-service to continuously update our normalized analysis of mutations and haplotypes, and to allow researchers to voluntarily share patient status information in a well-organized manner to improve analyses and making possible monitor the emergence of mutations and\/or haplotypes with patients preferences or different pathogenic features. Finally, we discuss currently structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santiago Justo Arevalo","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma, Universidad de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela Zapata Sifuentes","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Cesar Huallpa Robles","author_inst":"Universidad Agraria La Molina"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Landa Bianchi","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Adriana Castillo Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Romina Garavito-Salini Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Uceda-Campos","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Pineda Chavarria","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shuibing Chen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rene Jonkers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Mads Larsen","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Federica Linty","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anette Neele","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Frank van Baarle","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Cornelis van Drunen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Lisa Willemsen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wuhrer","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Harm Jan Bogaard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Menno P.J. de Winther","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Experimental Vascular Biology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jeroen den Dunnen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.199562","rel_title":"Identifying Key Determinants of SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 Tight Interaction","rel_date":"2020-07-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.199562","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Van A Ngo","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ramesh K Jha","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Cesar Huallpa Robles","author_inst":"Universidad Agraria La Molina"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Landa Bianchi","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Adriana Castillo Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Romina Garavito-Salini Casas","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Uceda-Campos","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Pineda Chavarria","author_inst":"Universidad Ricardo Palma"},{"author_name":"Christian Stevens","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benhur Lee","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shuibing Chen","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R. tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rene Jonkers","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Mads Larsen","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Federica Linty","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Anette Neele","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jan Nouta","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Frank van Baarle","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Cornelis van Drunen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vlaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Lisa Willemsen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wuhrer","author_inst":"LUMC, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Harm Jan Bogaard","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin, Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Menno P.J. de Winther","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry, Experimental Vascular Biology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jeroen den Dunnen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.199059","rel_title":"Tafenoquine inhibits replication of SARS-Cov-2 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations in vitro","rel_date":"2020-07-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.199059","rel_abs":"Tafenoquine [TQ] exhibited EC50\/90s of ~ 2.6\/5.1 M against SARS-CoV-2 in VERO E6 cells and was 4-fold more potent than hydroxychloroquine [HCQ].
