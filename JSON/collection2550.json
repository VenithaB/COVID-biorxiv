Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura A Rodriguez-Villamizar","author_inst":"Universidad Industrial de Santander"},{"author_name":"Luis Carlos Belalcazar-Ceron","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Julian Alfredo Fernandez-Nino","author_inst":"Universidad del Norte"},{"author_name":"Diana Marcela Marin-Pineda","author_inst":"Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana"},{"author_name":"Oscar Alberto Rojas-Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lizbeth Alexandra Acuna-Merchan","author_inst":"Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo"},{"author_name":"Nathaly Ramirez-Garcia","author_inst":"Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo"},{"author_name":"Sonia Cecilia Mangones-Matos","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Jorge Mario Vargas-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Julian Herrera-Torres","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Dayana Milena Agudelo-Castaneda","author_inst":"Universidad del Norte"},{"author_name":"Juan Gabriel Pineros-Jimenez","author_inst":"Universidad de Antioquia"},{"author_name":"Nestor Y Rojas-Roa","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Victor Mauricio Herrera-Galindo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159061","rel_title":"The Global Health Security Index is not predictive of coronavirus pandemic responses among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159061","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many countries with ripple effects felt in various sectors of the global economy. In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enoch J Abbey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Banda A.

This new disease had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition. In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resource-limited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Fernando L Paredes Sr.","author_inst":"Cardiology Department, Hospital General Enrique Cabrera, Mexico City."},{"author_name":"Ivan I Ilescas Jr.","author_inst":"General Hospital \"Enrique Cabrera\""},{"author_name":"Modupe O.

Implications of so-called Long Covid on neurological services and primary care and similarities with other neurological disorders are discussed. Methods: Firstly, a systematic overview of current reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 was conducted. Secondly the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect on neurological services and the similarities in the experience of patients with COVID-19 and those with other neurological disorders. Results: Twenty-nine systematic reviews were identified within seven databases, published between 11th April 2020 and 27th August 2020. The results indicated (so far), that COVID-19 exhibits two types of neurological symptoms; life threatening symptoms such as Guillain Barre Syndrome and encephalitis, and less devastating symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia. These so-called lesser symptoms appear to be emerging as longer-term for some sufferers and have been recently labelled Long Covid. When compared, these Long Covid symptoms are very similar to other neurological conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). Conclusions: Implications for neurological healthcare services in the UK may include longer waiting times and a need for more resources (including more qualified health professionals). There is also a possible change-effect on perceptions of other neurological conditions such as CFS and FND, particularly for health professionals. Future research is recommended to explore changes in perceptions of neurological symptoms because of COVID-19, particularly for health professionals.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamar Wildwing","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Holt","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Modupe O.

Under such circumstances, individual activities in social media and other online platforms will increase tremendously resulting in the circulation of information in the community. These pieces of information can be infodemic monikers misleading the community. Thus exploring the trends of public interest in searching COVID 19 related issues and checking information circulating in the public is highly crucial. Objective: This study aimed to explore users' concerns towards coronavirus related online web search and to investigate the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) adopted for identifying the virus in the early stage of COVID 19 spread in Ethiopia. Methods: Google Trends was employed in exploring the tendency towards coronavirus related web search activities in Ethiopia from March 13 to May 8, 2020. Keywords of the different names of COVID 19 and health related issues were used to investigate the trends of public interest in searching from Google over time. Relative search volume (RSV), Average peak comparison (APC), and associated graphs were used to compare the trends of online search interests. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to check for the presence of correlation. Result: During the study period, the top names users adopted to identify the virus in Ethiopia were corona, virus, coronavirus, corona virus, China coronavirus, and COVID 19. In almost all search activities, the users employed infodemic monikers to identify the virus (overall relative search percentage of 99%). Updates related issues (APC=60, 95% CI, 55, 66) were the most commonly trending health related searches on Google followed by mortality (APC=27, 95% CI, 24, 30) and symptoms (APC=55, 95% CI, 50, 60) related issues. The regional comparison showed the highest cumulative peak for the Oromia region (cumulative total RSVs, 536) followed by the Tigray region (cumulative total RSVs, 512) on querying health related information from Google. No significant correlation was detected between COVID 19 cases per region\/city and the maximum peaks of health related searches. Conclusion: This study revealed an initial increase in the public interest of COVID 19 related Google search, but this interest was declined over time. Tremendous circulation of infodemic monikers for the identification of the virus was also noticed in the country. The authors recommend for the government and other stakeholders to work immensely to keep the people alert on coronavirus-related issues and to promote the official names of the virus, like COVID 19, SARS CoV 2 in the public to decrease the circulation of misleading and misinformation amid the outbreak.

However they are not typically viewed as essential as China policymakers focus on economic growth. Only 38% of the heads of the public health departments of Chinese cities have a medical background. We find that cities with medical professionals as the head of public health departments had lower infection rates and death rates from COVID-19.

Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 4 October 2020. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support. Report highlights include: ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 102,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40% of patients >80 years experienced confusion. The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 102,959 individuals from 566 sites across 42 countries. The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals: 1. for whom data collection commenced on or before 14 September 2020. AND 2. who have laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-COV-2 infection. For the 88,463 cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report: o The median age is 72 years. o A total of 18% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit. o Antibiotic use is high (82.2% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.) o Fever, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms. o Altered consciousness\/confusion was also relatively frequent (19,619\/86,175) and most common in elderly patients.

Data from different testing sites indicates different rates of positivity. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows for semi-quantitative estimates of viral load as time to crossing threshold (Ct) is inversely related to viral load. Objectives The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV2 RNA loads between paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and deep lung (endotracheal aspirate or BAL) samples from critically ill patients. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results were retrospectively reviewed for 51 critically ill patients from 5 intensive care units in 3 hospitals ; Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge (3 units), Royal Papworth Cambridge (1 unit), and Royal Sunderland Hospital (1 unit). At the times when paired NP and deep lung samples were obtained, one patient had been on oxygen only, 6 patients on non-invasive ventilation, 18 patients on ECMO, and 26 patients mechanically ventilated. Results Results collected showed significant gradient between NP and deep lung viral loads. Median Ct value was 29 for NP samples and 24 for deep lung samples. Of 51 paired samples, 16 were negative (below limit of detection) on NP swabs but positive (above limit of detection) on deep lung sample, whilst 2 were negative on deep sample but positive on NP (both patients were on ECMO). Conclusions It has been suggested that whilst SARS-CoV1 tends to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV2 replicates more vigorously in the upper respiratory tract. These data challenge that assumption. These data suggest that viral migration to, and proliferation in, the lower respiratory tract may be a key factor in the progression to critical illness and the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Factors which promote this migration should be examined for association with severe COVID-19. From a practical point of view, patients with suspected severe COVID-19 should have virological samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract where-ever possible, as upper respiratory samples have a significant negative rate.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Islam Hamed","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Nesreen Shaban","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Marwan Nassar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Love","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Public Health England, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Webb","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Huina Yang","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Rostron","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Watson","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Razeenn Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Christiana Kartsonaki","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU).

Methods: We report the case of a high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 linked to an indoor choir rehearsal in France in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 27 participants, including 25 male singers, a conductor and an accompanist attended a choir practice on March 12, 2020. The practice was indoor and took place in a non-ventilated space of 45 m2. No choir member reported having been symptomatic for COVID-19 between March 2 and March 12.The mean age of the participants was 66.9 (range 35-86) years. 70% of the participants (19 of 27) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from 1 to 12 days after the rehearsal with a median of 5.1 days. 36% of the cases needed a hospitalization (7\/19), and 21% (4\/19) were admitted to an ICU. The index cases were possibly multiple. Discussion: The choir practice was planned in March 2020 at a period when the number of new cases of COVID-19 began to grow exponentially in France because SARS-CoV-2 was actively circulating. The secondary attack rate (70%) was much higher than it is described within households (10-20%) and among close contacts made outside households (0-5%). Singing might have contributed to enhance SARS-CoV-2 person-to-person transmission through emission of droplets and aerosolization in a closed non ventilated space with a relative high number of people including multiple pre-symptomatic suspected index cases. Conclusion: Indoor choir practice should be suspended during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Further studies are necessary to test the spread of the virus by the act of singing. As the benefits of the barrier measures and social distancing are known to be effective in terms of a reduction in the incidence of the COVID-19, experts recommendations concerning the resuming of choir practice are necessary.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie CHARLOTTE","author_inst":"SSR Val Rosay"},{"author_name":"Nesreen Shaban","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Marwan Nassar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Love","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Public Health England, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Webb","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Huina Yang","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Rostron","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Watson","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Razeenn Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Christiana Kartsonaki","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU).

The model thereby enables a dynamic inspection of the pandemic and allows estimating key figures, like the number of overall detected and undetected COVID-19 cases and the infection fatality rate. As proof of concept, the novel SIVRT model was used to simulate the first phase of the pandemic in Luxembourg. An overall number of infections of 13.000 and an infection fatality rate of 1,3% was estimated, which is in concordance with data from population-wide testing. Furthermore based on the data as of end of May 2020 and assuming a partial deconfinement, an increase of cases is predicted from mid of July 2020 on.

This virus can cause a disease that ranges in spectrum from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease with multiorgan failure, and the most severe cases are associated with some comorbidities and patient age. However, there are patients who do not have those risk factors who still develop serious disease. In this study, we identified the presence of other respiratory viruses in positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico to determine if any coinfections were correlated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. We analysed 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using RT-qPCR for the detection of 16 other respiratory viruses.Of the cases analysed, 14 (13.6%) were cases of coinfection, and 92% of them never required hospitalization, even when comorbidities and advanced age were involved. There were not significant differences between the presence of comorbidities and the mean ages of the groups. These results suggest that coinfection is not related to more severe COVID-19 and that, depending on the virus involved, it could even lead to a better prognosis. We believe that our findings may lay the groundwork for new studies aimed at determining the biological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs and for proposing corresponding strategies to limit the progression to severe cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larissa Fernandes-Matano","author_inst":"Divisi\u00f3n de Laboratorios de Vigilancia e Investigaci\u00f3n Epidemiol\u00f3gica.

We developed an agent-based model to precise the impact of digital contact tracing and household isolation on COVID-19 transmission. The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact-survey and epidemiological information to describe the risk factors for exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio R=2.6 and 50% detection of clinical cases, a ~20% app adoption reduces peak incidence of ~36%. With R=1.7, >30% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels. Higher coverage among adults, playing a central role in COVID-19 transmission, yields an indirect benefit for elderly. These results may inform the inclusion of digital contact tracing within a COVID-19 response plan.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jes\u00fas A.

Outdoor temperature is an important factor behind the current surge in US Covid-19 cases. Correlation of northern state infection data and outdoor temperatures is used to identify the change in disease transmission efficiency as northern states passed through the lower temperature bound (50F) in spring, and more recently transitioned to temperatures above the higher bound (70F). At current disease transmission efficiency levels, social distancing must be increased above a UMD Social Distance Index (SDI) level of 36 to stop the accelerated increase of daily infection cases. At current disease transmission efficiency (G=0.19) and SDI of 33, the US will approach 150,000 infections per day in September before declining as average US temperature falls below 70F. A primary reason for enhanced disease transmission below 50F and above 70F is attributed to inadequate indoor ventilation. Swing season occurs when outdoor temperatures are between 50F and 70F, and is the time of year when homes and buildings are opened to the outdoors. Increased fresh air ventilation (greater than 40cfm per person), improved air filtration (MERV11 and greater filters), and UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, 0.02WUV per cfm airflow) coupled with wearing face masks, 6ft distancing and surface sanitation are estimated to reduce indoor disease transmission probability to a third of the transmission probability resulting from standard building ventilation practice.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ty Newell","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Arregui-Garc\u013aa","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Piotr Bentkowski","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Livio Bioglio","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Alain Barrat","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Univ, Universite de Toulon, CNRS, CPT, Turing Center for Living Systems"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Terrance J.Y.

Serological surveys have been conducted to establish prevalence for covid-19 antibody in various cohorts and communities. However, the prevalence among healthcare workers is still being analyzed. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study participants were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job title, location, covid-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with covid-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 3,013 tested individuals, a total 2,932 were included in the analysis due to some missing data. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001) and loss of smell (p < .001). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, possible greater presence of cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity in healthcare workers vs. the general population may have contributed. Determining antibody prevalence in front-line workers, and duration of antibody presence may help stratify the workforce for risk, establish better health place policies and procedures, and potentially better mitigate transmission.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Brant-Zawadzki","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Deborah Fridman","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Philip Robinson","author_inst":"Infection Prevention, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zahn","author_inst":"Orange County Health Care Agency"},{"author_name":"Randy German","author_inst":"Laboratory Administrative Services, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Marcus Breit","author_inst":"Hoag Family Cancer Institute, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Junko Hara","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Terrance J.Y.

Objective: To develop and test the feasibility of a family medicine-led remote monitoring model of care (COVIDCare@Home program) to manage patients with COVID-19 in the community. Methods: This multi-faceted, family medicine-led, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program was developed at Womens College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. A cross-sectional chart review of the first cohort of patients was conducted and learnings from the implementation of CovidCare@Home are described. Results: During the study period, April 8 to May 11, 2020, there were 97 patients (average age 48.6, 62% female) with 424 recorded virtual visits with a median virtual length of stay of 8 days (IQR 5). 5.2% required escalation to an in-person visit with no patients requiring hospitalization. 16% of patients required support with mental and social health needs. Interpretations: A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely be used to manage outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Attention to mental and social health needs is critical for this population. Future efforts should consider how to design programs to best support populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, something which primary care is well-positioned to do. Further analysis will describe the effectiveness, impact, and satisfaction with the program among patients and providers.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Payal Agarwal","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Geetha Mukerji","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Celia Laur","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shivani Chandra","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nick Pimlott","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruth Heisey","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Stovel","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Goulbourne","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sacha Bhatia","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Onil Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danielle Martin","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonika Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilona Bahinskaya","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pinzon","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Zhang","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20158311","rel_title":"Hospital Trainees Worries, Perceived Sufficiency of Information and Reported Psychological Health During The COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20158311","rel_abs":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been unsurpassed in clinical severity or infectivity since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and continues to impact the world. During the A\/H1N1 influenza pandemic, healthcare workers presented frequent concerns regarding their ownand their families health, as well as high levels of psychological distress. Objectives: To assess hospital trainees concerns, perceived sufficiency of information, behaviour and reported psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the NHS Design: Cross-sectional 39-point questionnaire study conducted in May 2020 Setting: A large NHS foundation trust in London Participants: 204 hospital trainee doctors Outcome measures: Quantitative analysis of trainees worries and concerns while working during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed across 8 domains: trainee demographics; concerns and worries regarding COVID-19; perceived sufficiency of information about the COVID-19 pandemic; social distancing; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and training in PPE; COVID-19 acquisition and risk; reported psychological health; and medical education. Results: 91.7% looked after COVID-19 patients. 91.6% were worried about COVID-19; the most frequent concern was that of family and friends dying from COVID-19 (74.6%). 22.2% reported being infected with COVID-19. 6.8% of trainees were so concerned about COVID-19 infection that they would avoid going to work. Perceived sufficiency of information about COVID-19 was moderately high. 25.9% reported that they were able to socially distance at work compared to 94.4% able to socially distance outside work. 98.2% reported using PPE and 24.7% were confident the provided PPE protected them against infection with COVID-19. 41.9% reported that their psychological health had been affected by their work with the commonest being anxiety (56.6%), emotional distress (50.9%) and burnout (37.7%). 95.6% felt it is important to have a service that provides psychological support during this pandemic and 62.5% reported they would consider using this at work. Conclusions: A significant proportion of hospital trainees are worried about the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of reported psychological distress. Given that almost a third would not use psychological support services at work, hospital leaders and liaison psychiatry need to explore the reasons for not wanting to use services at work and highlight the provision of psychological services provided outside work such that provided by the London deaneries professional support unit (PSU). Seeking solutions to support trainee wellbeing in addition to this, such as larger offices, adequate rest facilities and alternative methods of teaching, with their input would enable empowerment of trainees and improve their health and morale while working in a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikoo Aziminia","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Aria Khani","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Colette Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Clifford Lisk","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ruth Heisey","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Stovel","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Goulbourne","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sacha Bhatia","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Onil Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danielle Martin","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonika Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilona Bahinskaya","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pinzon","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Zhang","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157990","rel_title":"Comparative Incidence and Outcomes of COVID-19 in Kidney or Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Recipients Versus Kidney or Kidney-Pancreas Waitlisted Patients: A Pilot Study","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157990","rel_abs":"Comparative COVID-19 epidemiologic studies between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients may provide insight into the impact of immunosuppressive medications on clinical outcomes.

Interventions mitigating progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 would markedly improve outcome and reduce healthcare utilization. We hypothesized that immunomodulation with IVIG would improve oxygenation and reduce length of hospital stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods. Patients with COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.5 g\/kg\/day x 3 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion versus SOC alone. Results. 16 subjects received IVIG plus SOC and 17 SOC alone. The median age was 51 years for SOC and 58 years for IVIG. APACHE II scores and Charlson comorbidity indices were similar for IVIG and SOC (median 7.5 vs 7 and 2 for both, respectively). Seven SOC versus 2 IVIG subjects required mechanical ventilation (p=0.12, Fisher exact test). Among subjects with A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg at enrollment, the IVIG group showed i) a lower rate of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (2\/14 vs 7\/12, p=0.038 Fisher exact test), ii) shorter median hospital length of stay (11 vs 19 days, p=0.01 Mann Whitney U), iii) shorter median ICU stay (2.5 vs 12.5 days, p=0.006 Mann Whitey U), and iv) greater improvement in PaO2\/FiO2 at 7 days (median [range] change from time of enrollment +131 [+35 to +330] vs +44.5 [-115 to +157], p=0.01, Mann Whitney-U test) than SOC. Conclusion. This pilot prospective randomized study comprising largely of Latino patients showed that IVIG significantly improved hypoxia and reduced hospital length of stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with A-a gradient >200 mm Hg.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Sakoulas","author_inst":"UCSD School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Geriak","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ravina Kullar","author_inst":"Expert Stewardship, Inc"},{"author_name":"Kristina Greenwood","author_inst":"Sharp Center for Research"},{"author_name":"MacKenzie Habib","author_inst":"Sharp Center for Research"},{"author_name":"Anuja Vyas","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mitra Ghafourian","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Venkata Naga Kiran Dintyala","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fadi Haddad","author_inst":"Sharp Grossmont Hospital"},{"author_name":"Onil Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danielle Martin","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonika Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilona Bahinskaya","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pinzon","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Zhang","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158048","rel_title":"Hospital-Based Donor Recruitment and Pre-Donation Serologic Testing for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158048","rel_abs":"Background: Major blood centers perform serologic testing on potential COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors retrospectively after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors may be an efficient way to prospectively identify potential donors. Study Design and Methods: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire (DHQ), and if eligible, were consented and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred to a local blood center for convalescent plasma collection. Results: Of 179 individuals screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for convalescent plasma donation to a local blood center (49.7% of those screened). IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23\/51 (45.1%) of participants with suspected COVID-19 and in 66\/77 (85.7%) of participants with self-reported PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Testing was performed at a median of 38 days since last symptoms. Participant age positively correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels. Time since last symptoms did not correlate with IgG or IgM levels. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed. Conclusion: A hospital based CCP donor recruitment program can prospectively identify potential CCP donors. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels has implications for selection of CCP units for transfusion.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joanna Balcerek","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Evelin Trejo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kendall Levine","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Paul Couey","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Zoe V Kornberg","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Camille Rogine","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Young","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian R Shy","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jordan E Taylor","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sara Bakhtary","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Terence Friedlander","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kara Lake Lynch","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Caryn Bern","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20158154","rel_title":"High stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA under minimal storage conditions for detection by Real-Time PCR","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20158154","rel_abs":"Reliable diagnosis, executed by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), builds the current basis in SARS-CoV-2 containment.

We simulated four levels of transmission rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing), and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths. When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8. However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths. Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3, the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of 10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 10.

The sequential introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) resulted in successful containment of the epidemic. A better understanding of how the timing of implementing NPIs influences the dynamics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics will be crucial for the management of a potential resurgence in Switzerland. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model that describes infection, hospitalization, recovery and death due to SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland. Using a maximum likelihood framework, we fitted the model to aggregated daily numbers of hospitalized patients, ICU occupancy and death from 25 February to 10 May 2020. We estimated critical parameters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and explored counterfactual scenarios of an earlier and later implementation of NPIs. RESULTS: We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.61 (95% compatibility interval, CI: 2.51-2.71) during the early exponential phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland. After the implementation of NPIs, the effective reproduction number approached Re = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61-0.66). Based on the observed doubling times of the epidemic before and after the implementation of NPIs, we estimated that one week of early exponential spread required 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.8-3.3 weeks) of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of infections to the same level. Introducing the same sequence of NPIs one week earlier or later would have resulted in substantially lower (399, 95% prediction interval, PI: 347-458) and higher (8,683, 95% PI: 8,038-9,453) numbers of deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of NPIs in March 2020 prevented thousands of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in Switzerland. Early implementation of NPIs during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can reduce the number of deaths and the necessary duration of strict control measures considerably.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Probst","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Center for Competence in Research NCCR TransCure, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julien L Riou","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pieter A Breur","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Eric Charles","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"David M Gaba","author_inst":"VA Palo Alto healthcare system and Stanford University school of medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Herbst","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ignarra","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Steffen Luitz","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Eric H Miller","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Brian Mong","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157933","rel_title":"A data-driven metapopulation model for the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic: assessing the impact of lockdown and exit strategies","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157933","rel_abs":"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several countries adopted measures of social distancing to a different degree. For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks. We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and serological data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown. Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure\/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period. Community contacts are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19. Regular re-assessment is crucial to adjust to evolving behavioral changes that can affect epidemic diffusion. In addition to social distancing, sufficient capacity for extensive testing and contact tracing is essential for successful mitigation.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"Antwerp University"},{"author_name":"Abrams Steven","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Sereina A.

While the duration and strength of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, specific antibody titres to related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to wane in recovered individuals, and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore different potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) after lockdown is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 409,000 infectious individuals; almost three-fold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary peak. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection if immunity to re-infection is not permanent.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Crellen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Li Pi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emma Davis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Pollington","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Tim C D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Diepreye Ayabina","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Borlase","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jaspreet Toor","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Graham F Medley","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"T Deirdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
