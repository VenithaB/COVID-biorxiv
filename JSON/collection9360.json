Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeliang Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi Lu","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Guo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Conghui Liao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qianlin Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Han","author_inst":"Shenyang Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.11.20022111","rel_title":"Healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerabilities towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic across China","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.11.20022111","rel_abs":"We integrate the human movement and healthcare resource data to identify cities with high vulnerability towards the 2019-nCoV epidemic with respect to available health resources.

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongdao Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Statistics, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China"},{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, USA"},{"author_name":"Yurui Cai","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Liu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue Li","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoping Zeng","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanpeng Chu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangcheng Zhu","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.08.20021212","rel_title":"Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients","rel_date":"2020-02-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.08.20021212","rel_abs":"Summary Background: To date, large amounts of epidemiological and case study data have been available for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which suggested that the mortality was related to not just respiratory complications. Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality. Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm. Funding: None.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Anti-2019-nCoV Volunteers","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, the General Hospital of Central Theater Command and Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jiwei Yao","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Guo","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 43500"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liao","author_inst":"Center for Neurointelligence, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."},{"author_name":"Siji Song","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jiali Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Guangjie Duan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038,China."},{"author_name":"Yuanxiu Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Zhansong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.05.20020107","rel_title":"Tobacco-use disparity in gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.05.20020107","rel_abs":"In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoshuai Cai","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, the General Hospital of Central Theater Command and Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan "},{"author_name":"Jiwei Yao","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Guo","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 43500"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liao","author_inst":"Center for Neurointelligence, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."},{"author_name":"Siji Song","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jiali Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Guangjie Duan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038,China."},{"author_name":"Yuanxiu Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Zhansong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.20021196","rel_title":"Tracking the spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) based on big data","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.20021196","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan in late 2019 have infected 34,598 people, and killed 723 among them until 8th February 2020.

We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Sanche","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yen Ting Lin","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Chonggang Xu","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ethan Romero-Severson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Siji Song","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Jiali Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology,  Tongji Hospital,  Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Guangjie Duan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038,China."},{"author_name":"Yuanxiu Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Wu","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Zhansong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.20021139","rel_title":"Networks of information token recurrences derived from genomic sequences may reveal hidden patterns in epidemic outbreaks: A case study of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus.","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.20021139","rel_abs":"Profiling the genetic evolution and dynamic spreading of viruses is a crucial task when responding to epidemic outbreaks.

However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weicheng Liang","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Feng","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shitao Rao","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cuicui Xiao","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zexiao Lin","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"The 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Qi","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yichi Yang","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Baoyin Yuan","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Andrei R.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Nikos I Bosse","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"James D Munday","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"CMMID nCoV working group","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taojiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.20021675","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.20021675","rel_abs":"Our manuscript was based on surveillance cases of COVID-19 identified before January 26, 2020.

However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6{+\/-}10 in Wuhan and March 20{+\/-}16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhai Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xumao Zhao","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yuehua Sun","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yixing Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Anran Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Neda Jalali","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Natalie Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Ira Longini","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"M.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Aiyin Zhang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Xu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Jia","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Tan","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Jiaqi Tian","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Tao Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zhenxian Quan","author_inst":"Beijing Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jiali Yu","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Army Engineering University of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoai Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liqun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.937862","rel_title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus - The species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.937862","rel_abs":"The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2\/Isolate\/Host\/Date\/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander E.

Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track-based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research.

As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seth Blumberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas M Lietman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Travis C Porco","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhuo","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Changxu Fan","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Gavriel Matt","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Daofeng Li","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Ting Wang","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jiali Yu","author_inst":"China Academy of Urban Planning and Design"},{"author_name":"Bo Xu","author_inst":"Army Engineering University of PLA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoai Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Liqun Fang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597 and Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Sc"},{"author_name":"Chong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Hailong Dong","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Perioprative Medicine, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi an 710032, China."},{"author_name":"Chuou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Yahua Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Min Han","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Hongbo Jia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Chen","author_inst":"Brain Research Center and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."},{"author_name":"Junan Yan","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.07.939389","rel_title":"The Pathogenicity of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in hACE2 Transgenic Mice","rel_date":"2020-02-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.07.939389","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in China has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

(2019-nCoV) in Mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jessica T.

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a \"public-health emergency of international concern\" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.\n\nMethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.\n\nResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.\n\nConclusionT cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miyssa I.

As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chong You","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Deng","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Sun","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiushi Lin","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Heng Pang","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Family Planning"},{"author_name":"Zhengchao Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"M.

To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bishajit Sarkar","author_inst":"Jahangirnagar University"},{"author_name":"Md.

The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1\/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tong Meng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Hao

of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic -ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the -ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linlin Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry, Center for Structural and Cell Biology in Medicine, University of Luebeck, 23562 Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Daizong Lin","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry, Center for Structural and Cell Biology in Medicine, University of Luebeck, 23562 Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Yuri Kusov","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry, Center for Structural and Cell Biology in Medicine, University of Luebeck, 23562 Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Yong Nian","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, 201203 Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry, Center for Structural and Cell Biology in Medicine, University of Luebeck, 23562 Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Jiang Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, 201203 Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Albrecht von Brunn","author_inst":"Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Pieter Leyssen","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Kristina Lanko","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adriaan de Wilde","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric J.

We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhidong Cao","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qingpeng Zhang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xin Lu","author_inst":"National University of Defense Technology"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Song","author_inst":"Chinese PLA Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Pei","author_inst":"Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Jia","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Dajun Zeng","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adriaan de Wilde","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric J.

2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases","rel_date":"2020-02-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.06.20020941","rel_abs":"Background: On January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingyuan Zhao","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yang Chen","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dylan S Small","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Song","author_inst":"Chinese PLA Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Pei","author_inst":"Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Jia","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Dajun Zeng","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"Rega Institute for Medical Research, University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Adriaan de Wilde","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Eric J.

acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces\/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P<0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte\/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray\/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei-jie Guan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wen-hua Liang","author_inst":"department of thoracic oncology, The First Affiliated Hosptial of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun-quan Ou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Jian-xing He","author_inst":"department of thoracic surgery and oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectio"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"The fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun-liang Lei","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"David SC Hui","author_inst":"Department of Medicine & Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Bin Du","author_inst":"Medical ICU, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lan-juan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospita"},{"author_name":"Guang Zeng","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kowk-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China;
