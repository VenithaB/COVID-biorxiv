Methods: A randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg\/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days. Result: Nine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3\/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7\/9, 77.8%, P=0.09). Conclusion: In our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number. Future studies with larger patient cohort are warranted to validate the role of ALA in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis. Conclusions: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Martin D Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Anjan Shah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ronak Shah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"George Zhou","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erica Kane","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Garrett Burnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shams Ranginwala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Madek","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gidiscin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chang Park","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Katz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Salter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"James B Eisenkraft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzan Uysal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarry","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Leibowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"David.reich@mountsinai.org"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.20.050088","rel_title":"Identification and enrichment of SECReTE cis-acting RNA elements in the Coronaviridae and other (+) single-strand RNA viruses","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.20.050088","rel_abs":"cis-acting RNA motifs play a major role in regulating many aspects of RNA biology including posttranscriptional processing, nuclear export, RNA localization, translation and degradation. Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs\/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated\/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gal Haimovich","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tsviya Olender","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Camila Baez","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey E Gerst","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"George Zhou","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erica Kane","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Garrett Burnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shams Ranginwala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Madek","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gidiscin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chang Park","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Katz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Salter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"James B Eisenkraft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzan Uysal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarry","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Leibowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"David.reich@mountsinai.org"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.047498","rel_title":"The crystal structure of nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer from SARS CoV-2in complex with S-adenosylmethionine","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.047498","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronaviridae family and is the etiological agent of the respiratory Coronavirus Disease 2019.

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soon Keong Wee","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Suppiah Paramalingam Sivalingam","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric Peng Huat Yap","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"David C Danko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Foox","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel Rosiene","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alon Shaiber","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebrahim Afshinnekoo","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew MacKay","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fritz J Sedlazeck","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nikolay A Ivanov","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria A Sierra","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diana Pohle","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Zietz","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Undina Gisladottir","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Vijendra Ramlall","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Craig D Westover","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Krista Ryon","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Young","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chandrima Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Phyllis Ruggiero","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bradley W Langhorst","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Justyna Gawrys","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Meleshko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter A D Steel","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amos J Shemesh","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jenny Xiang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jean Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Danielle Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Robert E Schwartz","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angelika Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bezdan","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"John Sipley","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Cong","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arryn Craney","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Priya Velu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ari Melnick","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Hajirasouliha","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacy M Horner","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Thomas Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tubingen"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Massimo Loda","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shawn Levy","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cushing","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shixiu Wu","author_inst":"Hangzhou Cancer Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Tatonetti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marcin Imielinski","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hanna Rennert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mason","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.20.046144","rel_title":"A scientometric overview of CORD-19","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.20.046144","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, researchers from all disciplines are coming together and contributing their expertise. CORD-19, a dataset of COVID-19 and coronavirus publications, has recently been made available alongside calls to help mine the information it contains and to create tools to search it more effectively. We analyse the delineation of the publications included in CORD-19 from a scientometric perspective. Based on a comparison to the Web of Science database, we find that CORD-19 provides an almost complete coverage of research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses. However, CORD-19 contains not only research that deals directly with COVID-19 and coronaviruses, but also research on viruses in general. Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS, MERS, COVID-19); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses; influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical medicine. CORD-19 publications that appeared in 2020, especially editorials and letters, are disproportionately popular on social media. While we fully endorse the CORD-19 initiative, it is important to be aware that CORD-19 extends beyond research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni Colavizza","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Costas","author_inst":"Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden University"},{"author_name":"Vincent A.

Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":103,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gokcen Eraslan","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Avinash Waghray","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Graham Heimberg","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Sikkema","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiko Kobayashi","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA"},{"author_name":"Eeshit Dhaval Vaishnav","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,"},{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Smillie","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Karthik Jagadeesh","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Thu Duong","author_inst":"University of California San Diego Department of Pediatrics, Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and\/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future.\n\nResultsHere we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches.\n\nConclusionsSimulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis. We may effectively be able to fast-forward through evolution using neural networks to investigate sequences that could arise.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa Caroline Crossman","author_inst":"SequenceAnalysis.co.uk & University of East Anglia, Norwich"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gokcen Eraslan","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Avinash Waghray","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Graham Heimberg","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Sikkema","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiko Kobayashi","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA"},{"author_name":"Eeshit Dhaval Vaishnav","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,"},{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Smillie","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Karthik Jagadeesh","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Thu Duong","author_inst":"University of California San Diego Department of Pediatrics, Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative  furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natacha Ogando","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Timmothy Dalebout","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jessika  C.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \"sandwich\" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Zeng","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Li","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jing Lin","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinlei Li","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd; School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yang Kong","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Shunze Zeng","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Du","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huahong Xiao","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shelin Zhang","author_inst":"Kezhi People&[prime]s Air-Defense Equipment Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Liu","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Here, we investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah K.

As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants [&ge;]1%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) [&ge;]1% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene - ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this study.\n\nAuthor SummaryWithin-host variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gage Kahl Moreno","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Katarina M Braun","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J Halfmann","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Trent M Prall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Kasen K Riemersma","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Haj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lalli","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Kelsey R Florek","author_inst":"Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelin Zhang","author_inst":"Kezhi People&[prime]s Air-Defense Equipment Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Liu","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain\/Europe.\n\nMethodsMaximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai.\n\nConclusionsMultiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries. These results highlight the extraordinary potential of SARS-CoV-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco D\u00edez Fuertes","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda - Instituto de Salud Carlos III \/ IDIBAPS - Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Iglesias Caballero","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Sara Monz\u00f3n","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Pilar Jim\u00e9nez","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Sarai Varona","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Isabel Cuesta","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel Zaballos","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Michael M.

Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsThe designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.\n\nConclusionsThe designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, this vaccine has high quality structure and suitable characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Yazdani","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alireza Rafiei","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammadreza Yazdani","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, 84156-83111, Iran"},{"author_name":"Reza Valadan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Sarai Varona","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Isabel Cuesta","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel Zaballos","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Michael M.

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate H.D.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 M. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 [A] resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chunlong Ma","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Sacco","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Brett Hurst","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Julia A Townsend","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yanmei Hu","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tommy Szeto","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

We constructed two independent lung protein interactome to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from both interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment. Interestingly, we propose that seven potential miRNAs, targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Shiek","author_inst":"Drug discovery lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"Prabu Paramasivam","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, USA."},{"author_name":"Kamal Raj","author_inst":"Madras Diabetic Research"},{"author_name":"Vishal Kumar","author_inst":"YRG CARE"},{"author_name":"Ram Murugesan","author_inst":"Drug discovery lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"RamaKrishanan V","author_inst":"Human Genetics lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Internet search interest was found highly correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but not yet applied to the U.S. Therefore, we examined the association of search interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. Methods: We extracted the COVDI-19 daily incidence and death data in the U.S. from two population-based datasets. The search interest of COVID-19 related terms was obtained using Google Trends. Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict future trends, respectively. Results: There were 555,245 new cases and 22,019 deaths of COVID-19 reported in the U.S. from March 1 to April 12, 2020. The search interest of COVID, COVID pneumonia, and COVID heart were correlated with COVDI-19 daily incidence with about 12-day of delay (Pearson r=0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19-day of delay (Pearson r=0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths appeared to both peak on April 10. The 4-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed moderate to good accuracies for predicting new cases (Pearson r=-0.641 to -0.833) and poor to good acuracies for daily new deaths (Pearson r=0.365 to 0.935). Conclusions: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the trends in COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. The prediction-models based on the search interest trend reached moderate to good accuracies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoling Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, Chin"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sabiha Hussain","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"He Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Nan Gao","author_inst":"Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Lanjing Zhang","author_inst":"Princeton Medical Center\/Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive group-testing approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCR-based diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Shental","author_inst":"Open University of Isarel"},{"author_name":"Shlomia Levy","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Shosh Skorniakov","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Vered Wuvshet","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Yonat Shemer-Avni","author_inst":"Soroka University Medical Center and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Angel Porgador","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Tomer Hertz","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively. Finally, the COVID-19-specific antibodies are significantly correlated with the clinical indices of viral infection and acute myocardial injury (p[&le;]0.05). Our data may help understand the function of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improve serology tests for rapid COVID-19 screening.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaomei Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Xian Wu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Dan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Minya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Xin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Te Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

We report onset, course, correlations with comorbidities, and diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab in 539 individuals suspected to carry SARS-COV-2 admitted to the hospital of Crema, Italy. All individuals underwent clinical and laboratory exams, SARS-COV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab, and chest X-ray and\/or computed tomography (CT). Data on onset, course, comorbidities, number of drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans), follow-up swab, pharmacological treatments, non-invasive respiratory support, ICU admission, and deaths were recorded. Among 411 SARS-COV-2 patients (66.6% males) median age was 70.5 years (range 1-99). Chest CT was performed in 317 (77.2%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 304 (96%). Fatality rate was 17.5% (74% males), with 6.6% in 60-69 years old, 21.1% in 70-79 years old, 38.8% in 80-89 years old, and 83.3% above 90 years. No death occurred below 60 years. Non-invasive respiratory support rate was 27.2% and ICU admission 6.8%. Older age, cough and dyspnea at onset, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal insufficiency, >7 drugs intake and positive X-ray, low lymphocyte count, high C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase values, and low PO2 partial pressure with high lactate at arterial blood gas analysis at admission were significantly associated with death. Use of ACE inhibitors or sartans was not associated with outcomes. Comorbidity network analysis revealed homogenous distribution of deceased and 60-80 aged SARS-COV-2 patients across diseases. Among 128 swab negative patients at admission (63.3% males) median age was 67.7 years (range 1-98). Chest CT was performed in 87 (68%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 76 (87.3%). Follow-up swab turned positive in 13 of 32 patients. Using chest CT at admission as gold standard on the entire study population of 539 patients, nasopharyngeal swab had 80% sensitivity. SARS-CoV-2 caused high mortality among patients older than 60 years and correlated with pre-existing multiorgan impairment. ACE inhibitors and sartans did not influence patients' outcome.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianpaolo Benelli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Buscarini","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Ciro Canetta","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe La Piana","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Merli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Vigano","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Sfogliarini","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Melilli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Guido Caldarelli","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Gili","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"IRCCS FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO NEUROLOGICO CARLO BESTA"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Several preventive measures have been recommended to halt the spread of the disease and its associated mortality. However, the level knowledge and practice of these preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, which constitute vulnerable groups, are yet to be evaluated. Aim: To determine the knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in Abakaliki. Materials and Methods: This was a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 among 284 antenatal clinic attendees at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. A pretested and validated questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results: Of 284 participants, 60.9% (n=173) had adequate knowledge of the preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. However, the overall practice of these preventive measures among the participants were poor as 69.7% of the participants were not practicing the preventive measures against the coronavirus. The determinants of poor practice of the preventive measures among the participants were being in age group 31-40 years (AOR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.26 - 5.37, p=0.022), married (AOR=2.99, 95%CI: 1.40 - 6.33, p=0.035) grandmultiparous (AOR=3.11, 95%CI: 1.32 - 6.56, p=0.021), residing in rural area (AOR=2.08, 95%CI: 1.32 - 4.05, p=0.031), and having no formal education (AOR=6.73, 95%CI: 2.66 - 18.34, p=0.002). Conclusion: The study showed that most of the participants had adequate knowledge of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection but the practice of these preventive measures were poor among the participants.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johnbosco Ifunanya Nwafor","author_inst":"Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kenechi Aniukwu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Qatif Central Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Bonaventure Okechukwu Anozie","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki"},{"author_name":"Arinze Chidiebere Ikeotuonye","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki."},{"author_name":"James M Cooke","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Deena Kelly Costa","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Richard M Eakin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Hallie C Prescott","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Margaret S Woolridge","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Guido Caldarelli","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Gili","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"IRCCS FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO NEUROLOGICO CARLO BESTA"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Patchy virological testing has hampered interpretation of confirmed case counts, and unknown rates of asymptomatic and mild infections make it challenging to develop evidence-based public health policies. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel B Larremore","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Bailey K Fosdick","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Kate M Bubar","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Sam Zhang","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

There is an urgent need for reliable antibody detection approaches to support diagnosis, vaccine development, safe release of individuals from quarantine, and population lock-down exit strategies. We set out to evaluate the performance of ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices. Design: We tested plasma for COVID (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different LFIA devices. Setting: We performed laboratory work at the University of Oxford. Participants: We used a panel of plasma samples from individuals who have had confirmed COVID infection based on a PCR result (n=40), and pre-pandemic negative control samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142). Main outcome measures: We recorded optical density results from ELISA experiments and positive\/negative\/invalid results from LFIA devices. Results: ELISA detected IgM or IgG in 34\/40 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs. 0\/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31\/31 COVID-positive individuals tested [&ge;]10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar. Conclusions: Currently available commercial LFIA devices do not perform sufficiently well for individual patient applications. ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following first symptoms.","rel_num_authors":71,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Ainsworth","author_inst":"Oxford University

We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the official COVID-19 death rate, but exceeds it by a factor of at least 1.5. Our analysis suggests that there is a large population of predominantly older people that are missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 49,000-53,000 as of May 9 2020, as compared to the official number of 33,000. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.26% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.58% in the most affected province of Bergamo. These PFRs constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We combine the PFRs with the Test Positivity Ratio to derive a better lower bound of 0.61% on the IFR for Lombardia. We further estimate the IFR as a function of age and find a steeper age dependence than previous studies: we find 17% of COVID-related deaths are attributed to the age group above 90, 7.5% to 80-89, declining to 0.04% for age 40-49 and 0.01% for age 30-39, the latter more than an order of magnitude lower than previous estimates. We observe that the IFR traces the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above ages of 60 years, which can be used as a model to estimate the IFR for other populations and thus other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and that 27% of the total COVID-19 fatalities in NYC should arise from the population below 65 years. This is in agreement with the official NYC data and three times higher than the percentage observed in Lombardia. Combining the PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates (IR) for regions in Italy. These peak in Lombardia at 26% (13%-47%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 69% (35%- 100%, 95% c.l.). These estimates suggest that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, e.g., by a factor of 35 in Lombardia.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chirag Modi","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Boehm","author_inst":"University of California,

These are the two questions we raise by studying the number of new cases arising after lockdowns in a few European countries. The analysis which purely relies on the publicly available data of the numbers of new infections, rather than extensive contact tracing of individual patients, suggests a memory of the infections in the community with a median of 13.3 days. This distribution of the memory of infections which may even be considered as a surrogate of the incubation time in a perfect lockdown, suggests that even a perfect quarantine of 30 days is only 90% complete.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Vanessa
