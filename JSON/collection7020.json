Yet, data streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with advanced modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform is backed up by advanced time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data which is enhanced by the capability of measuring the expected impact of preventive interventions such as social distancing and lockdowns. The platform enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restriction such as models developed for specific time window of the data. Our policy assessment of the case of Australia, shows that social distancing and travel ban restriction significantly affect the reduction of number of cases, as an effective policy.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taha Hossein Rashidi","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Siroos Shahriari","author_inst":"UNSW Sudney"},{"author_name":"AKM Azad","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Vafaee","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079830","rel_title":"FIRST DETECTION OF SARS-COV-2 IN UNTREATED WASTEWATERS IN ITALY","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079830","rel_abs":"Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2. The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppina La Rosa","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Marcello Iaconelli","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Pamela Mancini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Giusy Bonanno Ferraro","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079848","rel_title":"Effects of latency and age structure on the dynamics and containment of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079848","rel_abs":"In this paper we develop an SEIR-type model of COVID-19, with account for two particular aspects: non-exponential distribution of incubation and recovery periods, as well as age structure of the population. For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of quarantine in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed quarantine duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the quarantine can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration quarantine is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the quarantine is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing quarantine duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different quarantine durations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstantin B Blyuss","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Yuliya N Kyrychko","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Pamela Mancini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Giusy Bonanno Ferraro","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078667","rel_title":"Cell-based therapies for COVID-19: A living systematic review","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078667","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the available evidence on the role of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 23, 2020 (one day before submission). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomised trials evaluating the effect of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomised trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. RESULTS: We screened 1,043 records but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomised trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision makers in the near future.

However, it remains unclear if the disparity in mortality is due to gender differences in high-risk characteristics. Objective To study the clinical characteristics of a large and diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and determine the outcomes after matching for age and other high-risk characteristics. Design Retrospective cohort between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2020 Setting TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network consisting of multiple healthcare organizations (HCOs) predominantly in the United States Participants and Exposure A cohort of male and female patients > 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 identified with real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients from participating HCOs. A 1:1 propensity score matching of cohorts was performed for age, race, nicotine use, and all possible confounding comorbidities. Main Outcome Risk of mortality, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 Results A total of 5980 males and 7730 females diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. Males were significantly older than females (54.9 (18.3) vs. 50.9 (18.4), p-value <0.0001). There were significant differences in patient characteristics, but after propensity matching, both groups (N=5350 each group) were balanced. Males had a significantly higher risk for mortality both before (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and after matching (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Similarly, the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) was significantly higher in males even after matching. On subanalysis, males age > 50 had higher mortality than matched females of similar age (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), whereas the risk of mortality in matched groups < 40 years was similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.4-2.4). Conclusion In conclusion, males are more severely affected and have higher mortality from COVID-19. This gender-specific risk is especially more pronounced in advanced age. Gender disparity in poor outcomes can only be partially explained by differences in high-risk behavior and comorbidities. Further research is needed to understand the causes of this disparity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shailendra Singh","author_inst":"Charleston Area Medical Center, Charleston WV"},{"author_name":"Monica Chowdhry","author_inst":"West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Arka Chatterjee","author_inst":"Division of Cardiovascular Disease, University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Khan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078782","rel_title":"Clinical Laboratory Parameters Associated with Severe or Critical Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078782","rel_abs":"Background: To date, several clinical laboratory parameters associated with COVID-19 severity have been reported. However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] x109 cells\/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) x109 cells\/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells\/l, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg\/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg\/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng\/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg\/ml). Conclusions and Relevance: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jude Moutchia","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pratik Pokharel","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aldiona Kerri","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kaodi McGaw","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shreeshti Uchai","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miriam Nji","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Goodman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078949","rel_title":"Reconstructed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078949","rel_abs":"Background. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting select genes of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been the main diagnostic tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the test has not been studied systematically outside of the laboratory setting. The aim of this study is to provide estimates of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR test developed by China CDC. Methods. The study design is a secondary analysis of published findings on 1014 patients in Wuhan, China, of whom 601 tested positive and 413 were negative for COVID-19. Sensitivity and specificity were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach from probabilistic knowledge of the diagnostic errors. Predictive values of the test were calculated, resulting in estimates for the number of confirmatory tests that are needed for establishing the presence or absence of COVID-19, depending on the prior probability of a patient having the disease. Results. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated to be 0.777 (95% CI: 0.715, 0.849), while the specificity was 0.988 (95% CI: 0.933, 1.000). The confidence intervals include sampling error in addition to the error due to probabilistic knowledge of the data. Discussion. The Chinese version of the RT-PCR test had a conspicuous rate of false negative results, likely missing between 15% and 29% of patients with COVID-19. For a patient with a prior probability of COVID-19 greater than 18%, at least two negative test results would be needed to lower the chances of COVID-19 below 5%. Caution is advised in generalizing these findings to other versions of the RT-PCR test that are being used in diverse geographic regions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil S Padhye","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Pratik Pokharel","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aldiona Kerri","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kaodi McGaw","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shreeshti Uchai","author_inst":"EHESP French School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miriam Nji","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Goodman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079095","rel_title":"Pooled RNA sample reverse transcriptase real time PCR assay for SARS CoV-2 infection: a reliable, faster and economical method.","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079095","rel_abs":"Background: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which initially started as a cluster of pneumonia cases in the Wuhan city of China has now become a full blown pandemic.

Here, we quantify and characterize intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 raw sequence data uploaded to SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two sequencing methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq). Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic, mapped to the WuhanHu1 reference genome using Bowtie2, and variants called with bcftools mpileup. To ensure sufficient coverage, we only included samples with 10X coverage for >90% of the genome (n=406 samples), and only variants with a depth >=10. Derived (i.e. non-reference) alleles were found at 408 sites. The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295\/406) having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 < 0.1, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms were observed >1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% - 48.5%. 33\/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37\/66 changes were non-synonymous. At 10\/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10\/10 positions, while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7\/10 positions. In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting from amplification and\/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent with true underlying variation. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics, particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease progression.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Rose","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"David J Nolan","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Samual Moot","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Amy Feehan","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sissy Cross","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Julia Garcia-Diaz","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation"},{"author_name":"Susanna L Lamers","author_inst":"Bioinfoexperts, LLC"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Dubey","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079806","rel_title":"A fractional-order SEIHDR model for COVID-19 with inter-city networked coupling effects","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079806","rel_abs":"A novel coronavirus, designated as COVID-19, e-merged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Based on inter-city networked cou-pling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, in-fected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during in-cubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numer-ical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stim-ulated by using the real-data from 23 January to 18 - m March, 2020 where m is equal to the number of predic-tion days. Compared with integer-order system ( = 0), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case with-out network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and unique-ness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic re-production number R0 is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymp-totically stable when R0 [&le;] 1, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenzhen Lu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yongguang Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"YangQuan Chen","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Guojian Ren","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Conghui Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shuhui Lu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Yin","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Dubey","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079178","rel_title":"A COVID-19 epidemic model integrating direct and fomite transmission as well as household structure","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079178","rel_abs":"This paper stresses its base contribution on a new SIR-type model for COVID-19 including direct and fomite transmission as well as the effect of distinct household structures.

We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: 1. amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020 and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up, or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% CI 17-25) with a prediction interval of 3-67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26-37%, prediction interval 24-38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is pre-symptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was slightly lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10-1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases, we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections, and that the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this living systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggest that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection. The contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana C Buitrago-Garcia","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland; Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dianne Egli-Gany","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Michel J Counotte","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Hossmann","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Hira Imeri","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Aziz Mert Ipekci","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern,, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Georgia Salanti","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicola Low","author_inst":"University of Bern"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079863","rel_title":"Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079863","rel_abs":"Background: The relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Methodology: Data were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [&ge;]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020. Results: Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates. Conclusions: The COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine Simbana-Rivera","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Lenin Gomez-Barreno","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Jhon Guerrero","author_inst":"Scientific Association of Medical Students, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Simbana-Guaycha","author_inst":"Scientific Association of Medical Students, Universidad Central del Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Raul Fernandez","author_inst":"One Health Global research group, Universidad de las Americas, Quito, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Andres Lopez-Cortes Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad UTE"},{"author_name":"Alex Lister","author_inst":"University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Esteban Ortiz-Prado","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079640","rel_title":"COVID-19 Outcomes in Saudi Arabia and the UK: A Tale of Two Kingdoms","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079640","rel_abs":"Background: While the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world is starting to peak, it is essential to point out how different countries manage the outbreak and how different measures and experience resulted in different outcomes. This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model. Method: Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness. Result: We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government. Conclusion: We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi. Actions were taken by Saudi Arabia under the national slogan (We are all responsible) resulted in the observed reduced number of current and predicted cases and deaths compared to the UK approach (keep calm and carry on).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saleh Komies","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdulelah M Aldhahir","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ali Alqarni","author_inst":"Centre of Host Microbe Interaction (CHMI), Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, Kings College London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tope Oyelade","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaber S Alqahtani","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Esteban Ortiz-Prado","author_inst":"OneHealth Global Research Group, Universidad De Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Guresh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078907","rel_title":"Pneumask: Modified Full-Face Snorkel Masks as Reusable Personal Protective Equipment for Hospital Personnel","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078907","rel_abs":"Here we adapt and evaluate a full-face snorkel mask for use as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, who lack appropriate alternatives during the COVID-19 crisis in the spring of 2020. The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurel Kroo","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anesta Kothari","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Melanie Hannebelle","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"George Herring","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thibaut Pollina","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ray Chang MD","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and Platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3+ Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and Platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in Platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with Platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and Platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and Platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy. Therefore, our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreya Johri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Deepali Jain","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ishaan Gupta","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"George Herring","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thibaut Pollina","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ray Chang MD","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Samhita P.

A novel pneumonia (COVID-19) which is sweeping the globe was started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Most deaths occurred in severe and critically cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severe ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, so we prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severe ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term in the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods. In this single-centered, prospective and observational study, we enrolled 114 severe ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and laboratory information were collected at baseline, data on treatment and outcome were collected until the day of death or discharge or for the first 28 days after severe ill diagnosis, whichever was shorter. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome. Results. Among enrolled 114 patients, 94 (82.5%) had good outcome while 20 (17.5%) had poor outcome. No significant differences were showed in age, gender and the prevalence of coexisting disorders between outcome groups. Results of multivariate Cox analyses indicated that higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460) and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days. In the other hand, higher levels of leucocytes (HR, 5.575; 95% CI, 2.080-14.943), neutrophils (HR, 2.566; 95% CI, 1.022-6.443), total bilirubin (HR, 6.171; 95% CI, 2.458-15.496), globulin (HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 1.027-6.211), blood urea nitrogen (HR, 5.640; 95% CI, 2.193-14.509), creatine kinase-MB (HR, 3.032; 95% CI, 1.203-7.644), lactate dehydrogenase (HR, 4.607; 95% CI, 1.057-20.090), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (HR, 5.023; 95% CI, 1.921-13.136), lactate concentration (HR,15.721; 95% CI, 2.099-117.777), Interleukin-10 (HR, 3.551; 95% CI, 1.280-9.857) and C-reactive protein (HR, 5.275; 95% CI, 1.517-18.344) were associated with increased risk of poor outcome development. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from severe to mild. Conclusion. In summary, we firstly reported this single-centered, prospective and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation responses, liver, kidney, cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in final outcome of severe ill patients with COVID-19. Our study will provide clinicians to be benefit to rapidly estimate the likelihood risk of short-term poor outcome for severe patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaobo Feng Sr.","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Peiyun Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liang Ma","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hang Liang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Lei","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenqiang Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Song","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuai Li","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Yang","author_inst":"Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Cao Yang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Emma Pan","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"Khang Vu","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"Kelly Yen","author_inst":"Olin College"},{"author_name":"James Dale","author_inst":"Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Patrick Kolbay","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Simon Ellgas","author_inst":"Waymo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Konte","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Rozhin Hajian","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Grace Zhong","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Noah Jacobs","author_inst":"Mountain View, CA"},{"author_name":"Amit Jain","author_inst":"Mountain View, CA"},{"author_name":"Filip Kober","author_inst":"Poznan, Poland"},{"author_name":"Gerry Ayala","author_inst":"WildHorn Outfitters, Utah"},{"author_name":"Quentin Allinne","author_inst":"Decathlon"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cucinelli","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dave Kasper","author_inst":"iSnorkel"},{"author_name":"Luca Borroni","author_inst":"Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrick Gerber","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Ross Venook","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter Baek MD","author_inst":"US.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8\/13 (62%) vs. 17\/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20\/27 (74%) available saliva; 7\/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13\/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. Conclusions: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nguyen Van Vinh Chau","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Vo Thanh Lam","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Dung","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Lam Minh Yen","author_inst":"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ngo Ngoc Quang Minh","author_inst":"Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Manh Hung","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nghiem My Ngoc","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tri Dung","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Dinh Nguyen Huy Man","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Lam Anh Nguyet","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Thanh Hoang Nhat","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Nguyen Truc Nhu","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Han Ny","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thu Hong","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Evelyne Kestelyn","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Phuong Dung","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thanh Phong","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tran Chan Xuan","author_inst":"Cu Chi Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Tran Tinh Hien","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Tran Nguyen Hoang Tu","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ronald B.

ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and differences in expression may affect susceptibility to COVID-19. Using HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals, we discovered that among genes negatively correlated with ACE2, interferon signalling pathways were highly enriched and observed down-regulation of ACE2 after interferon-alpha treatment. Negative correlation was also found in the gastrointestinal tract and in lung tissue from a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 infection suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across tissue and species. Performing a genome-wide eQTL analysis, we discovered that polymorphisms in the interferon lambda (IFNL) region are associated with ACE2 expression. Increased ACE2 expression in the liver was also associated with age and presence of cirrhosis. Polymorphisms in the IFNL region may impact not only antiviral responses but also ACE2 with potential consequences for clinical outcomes in distinct ethnic groups and with implications for therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.\n\nMethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.\n\nResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.\n\nConclusionThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jody Phelan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wouter Deelder","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ward","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susana Campino","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin L Hibberd","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taane G Clark","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hua Lin","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qi Zeng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Da-Yu Wu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ming Tang","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Di Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zonghua Liu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Cheng Lai","author_inst":"Arizona State University - Tempe Campus"},{"author_name":"Angela Mo","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"Greg Gibson","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"John McLauchlan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1qh,"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"Tang Chi Thuong","author_inst":"Department of Health, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Luca Borroni","author_inst":"Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrick Gerber","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Ross Venook","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter Baek MD","author_inst":"US.

In addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs (nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsHere, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine the 5 and 3 coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these samples.\n\nResultsUsing junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33% of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5 and 3 junction points, we show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only 5 regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the landscape of viral open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsWe identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason Nomburg","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Meyerson","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"James A.

In this paper we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all these five isolates and also compared for their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and the other at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only and one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western part of India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"FEROZA BEGUM","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DEBICA MUKHERJEE","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DLUYA THAKRIKI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"SANDEEPAN DAS","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"PREM PRAKASH TRIPATHI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"ARUP KUMAR BANERJEE","author_inst":"North Bengal Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"UPASANA RAY","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qi Zeng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Da-Yu Wu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ming Tang","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Di Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zonghua Liu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Cheng Lai","author_inst":"Arizona State University - Tempe Campus"},{"author_name":"Angela Mo","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"Greg Gibson","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"John McLauchlan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1qh,"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"Tang Chi Thuong","author_inst":"Department of Health, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU"},{"author_name":"Luca Borroni","author_inst":"Italy"},{"author_name":"Patrick Gerber","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Ross Venook","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter Baek MD","author_inst":"US.

The GAG heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including the S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and more recently we have demonstrated that heparin can block cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Heparin has found widespread clinical use as anticoagulant drug and this molecule is routinely used as a proxy for the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), a structural analogue located on the cell surface, which is a known receptor for viral invasion. Previous work has demonstrated that unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, inducing distinct conformational change and we have further explored the structural features of heparin with regard to these interactions. In this article, previous research is expanded to now include a broader range of GAG family members, including heparan sulphate. This research demonstrates that GAGs, other than those of heparin (or its derivatives), can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor binding domain and induce distinct conformational changes within this region. These findings pave the way for future research into next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Yong Li","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Scott Guimond","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we designed optimal fluorogenic substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro which reveals their inhibitory mechanisms and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Lastly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARS-CoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and structure analysis provides a basis for. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zongyang Lv","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Zmudzinski","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Patchett","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Digant Nayak","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Scott J Snipas","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Farid El Oualid","author_inst":"UbiQ Bio B.V."},{"author_name":"Miklos Bekes","author_inst":"Arvinas, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Tony T Huang","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaun K Olsen","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marco Guerrini","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.
