We show that, as of May 3, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in New York City and surrounding areas, the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Furthermore, we see evidence that, after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population.

A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8\/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2). On contrary, being a driver, business entrepreneur and a security personnel were found to have less rate in awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robinson Ssebuufu","author_inst":"Kampala International University Western Campus"},{"author_name":"Franck Sikakulya","author_inst":"kampala international university western campus"},{"author_name":"Simon Mambo Binezero","author_inst":"Kampala International University Western Campus"},{"author_name":"Lucien Wasingya","author_inst":"Kitovu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sifa K.

Electronic cigarette use (vaping) rapidly gained popularity in the US in recent years. Whether electronic cigarette users (vapers) are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection is unknown. Methods Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureau and the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of weighted proportions of vapers with number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in the US. Results The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 infected cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 infected cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554 - 0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3705 (95% CI: 0.0623 - 0.6786) in log scale in each US state. Conclusions The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in each US state suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 infections and deaths.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical & Translational Research, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel P.

This will lead to negative impacts in many sectors. Saudi Arabia not only plays an important role on the economical side because it is the leading country in oil production, but also because it is considered the heart of the Islamic countries. Although protective measures have been implemented in Saudi Arabia, the number of COVID-19 cases has increased. Aims of the study: This study aimed to employ SIR model to forecast the peak of COVID-19 progression and an estimation of it is end in Saudi Arabia. Method: Based on the World Health Organization data on COVID-19 progression in Saudi Arabia from March 3rd to April 29th, 2020, we reliably estimate the constant parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and potential ending time. Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered are the main components of the SIR model that were used to run the analysis. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 20th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 20th of May. Then the cases will decrease until the 55th day, which is around June 20th. Conclusion: The result predicts a second peak and an estimation end of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. This data can inform the policy makers, who should try to contain the virus, to be prepared for what is coming next.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"haitham khoj","author_inst":"Knig Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Alaa F Mujallad","author_inst":"University of Jeddah"},{"author_name":"Deborah J.

For SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers. METHODS We define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. Based on the DS4C project data on SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 in South Korea, we estimate the means of the diagnostic serial interval, the clinical onset serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS The mean of the diagnostic serial interval was estimated to be 3.63 days (95% CI: 3.24, 4.01). The diagnostic serial interval was shown to be significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.12 days, 95% CI: -1.98, -0.26). CONCLUSIONS The relatively short diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 in South Korea are likely due to the country's extensive efforts towards contact tracing. We suggest the mean diagnostic serial interval as a new indicator for the effectiveness of a country's contact tracing as part of the epidemic surveillance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia Kyonhi Mettler","author_inst":"1.

The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy\/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K\/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Krystyna Taylor","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pearson","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Laura Jantsch Ferla","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda Santos Puga","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Virginia Fernandes Moca Trevisani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Universidade Santo Amaro"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091975","rel_title":"BCG vaccine-induced protection from COVID-19 infection, wishful thinking or a game changer?","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20091975","rel_abs":"A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; p = 8 X 10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis E Escobar","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Molina-Cruz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Carolina Barillas-Mury","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Laura Jantsch Ferla","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria Eduarda Santos Puga","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Virginia Fernandes Moca Trevisani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Universidade Santo Amaro"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092551","rel_title":"A preliminary study on analytical performance of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgG and application in clinical practice","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092551","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the performance of serological test and dynamics of serum antibody with the progress of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: A total of 419 patients were enrolled including 19 confirmed cases and 400 patients from fever clinics. Their serial serum samples collected during the hospitalization were menstruated for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using gold immunochromatographic assay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of antibody detection. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress and false positive factors for antibody testing were also analyzed. Results: The positive rate of IgG detection was 91.67% and 83.33% using two CLIA, respectively. However, the IgM positive rate was dramatically declined might due to the lack of blood samples at early stages of the disease. The chemiluminescence immunoassay had a favorable but narrow linear range. Our work showed increased IgG values in serums from virus-negative patients and four negative samples were IgG weak-positive after thermal incubation. Our data showed the specificity of viral N+S proteins was higher than single antigen. Unlike generally thought that IgM appeared earlier than IgG, there is no certain chronological order of IgM and IgG seroconversion in COVID-19 patients. It was difficult to detect antibodies in asymptomatic patients suggesting that their low viral loads were not enough to cause immune response. Analysis of common interferent in three IgG false-positive patients, such as rheumatoid factor, proved that false positives were not caused by these interfering substances and antigenic cross-reaction. Conclusions: Viral serological test is an effective means for SARS-CoV-2 infect detection using both chemiluminescence immunoassay and gold immunochromatographic assay. Chemiluminescence immunoassay against multi-antigens has obvious advantages but still need improve in reducing false positives.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Danping Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Huacheng Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Southern Theatre Comman"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Quan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhan Kuang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Weiyun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ling Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Ting Lei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Aiwu Luo","author_inst":"Department of disease control and prevention, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Sun","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Linhai Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092296","rel_title":"Ethnicity and risk of death in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection: an observational cohort study in an urban catchment area","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092296","rel_abs":"Objectives. To determine if specific ethnic groups are at higher risk of mortality from COVID19 infection. Design. Retrospective cohort study Setting. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) in Birmingham, UK Participants. Patients with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection requiring admission to UHB between 10th March 2020 and 17th April 2020 Exposure. Ethnicity Main outcome measures. Standardised Admission Ratio (SAR) and Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each ethnicity was calculated using observed sex specific age distributions of COVID19 admissions and deaths and 2011 census data for Birmingham\/Solihull. Hazard Ratio (aHR) for mortality was estimated for each ethnic group with white population as reference group, using Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, social deprivation and co-morbidities, and propensity score matching. Results. 2217 patients admitted to UHB with a proven diagnosis of COVID19 were included. 58.2% were male, 69.5% White and the majority (80.2%) had co morbidities. 18.5% were of South Asian ethnicity, and these patients were more likely to be younger (median age 61 years vs.77 years), have no co morbidities (27.8% vs. 16.6%) but a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (48.0% vs 28.2%) than White patients. SAR and SMR suggested more admissions and deaths in South Asian patients than would be predicted. South Asian patients were also more likely to present with severe disease despite no delay in presentation since symptom onset. South Asian ethnicity was associated with an increased risk of death; both by Cox regression (Hazard Ratio 1.66 (95%CI 1.32 to 2.10)) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation and comorbidities and by propensity score matching, (Hazard ratio 1.68 (1.33 to 2.13), using the same factors but categorising ethnicity into South Asian or not. Conclusions. Current evidence suggests those of South Asian ethnicity may be at risk of worse COVID19 outcomes, further studies need to establish the underlying mechanistic pathways.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sapey","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Suzy Gallier","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Mainey","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Peter Nightingale","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David McNulty","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Crothers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Felicity Evison","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FoundationTrust"},{"author_name":"Katharine Reeves","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Domenico Pagano","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alastair K Denniston","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Peter Diggle","author_inst":"University of Lancaster"},{"author_name":"Simon Ball","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Nagib Atallah","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo\/Cochrane Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092288","rel_title":"Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections with colorimetric RT-LAMP and LAMP sequencing","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092288","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a significant public-health problem. In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (\"swab-to-RT-LAMP\"). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel. We propose decentralised COVID-19 testing as a routine to allow facilities and institutions to return to near-to-full functionality.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viet Loan Dao Thi","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Konrad Herbst","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Boerner","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthias Meurer","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Lukas P M Kremer","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kirrmaier","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Andrew Freistaedter","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Papagiannidis","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Carla Galmozzi","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Steffen Klein","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petr Chandla","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dina Khalid","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabel Barreto Miranda","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul Schnitzler","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Kraeusslich","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Knop","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Simon Anders","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092346","rel_title":"IKONOS: An intelligent tool to support diagnosis of Covid-19 by texture analysis of x-ray images","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092346","rel_abs":"In late 2019, the SARS-Cov-2 spread worldwide.

Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Methods We retrospectively studied the relationship between RDW and COVID19 mortality risk for 1198 adult patients diagnosed with SARS COV2 at 4 Partners Healthcare Network Hospitals between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Findings Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with increased mortality in patients of all ages with a risk ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8). Stratified by age, the risk ratio was 6.2 (4.4-7.9, N = 312) < 50 years, 3.2 (2.5-4.1, N = 230) 50-60, 2.3 (1.6-3.1, N = 236) 60-70, 1.2 (0.7-1.8, N = 203) 70-80, and 1.9 (1.5-2.3, N = 216) > 80 years. RDW was significantly associated with mortality in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-Dimer, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities (p < 1e-4 for RDW in all cases). Patients whose RDW increased during admission had a ~3-fold elevation in mortality risk compared to those whose RDW did not change. Interpretation Elevated RDW at diagnosis and an increase in RDW during admission are both associated with increased mortality risk for adult COVID19 patients at a large academic medical center network.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brody H Foy","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan CT Carlson","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erik Reinertsen","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Raimon Padros Valls","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roger Pallares Lopez","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric Palanques-Tost","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mow","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"M Brandon Westover","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aaron D Aguirre","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John M Higgins","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petr Chandla","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dina Khalid","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabel Barreto Miranda","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paul Schnitzler","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Kraeusslich","author_inst":"Center of Infectious Diseases, Department of Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Knop","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Simon Anders","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), University of Heidelberg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091983","rel_title":"Severe obesity is associated with higher in-hospital mortality in a cohort of patientswith COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York","rel_date":"2020-05-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20091983","rel_abs":"Background & Aims: New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg\/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI <25 kg\/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg\/m2: 17.2%, BMI[&ge;]35 kg\/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03).

Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found that Non-White persons were more likely to test positive compared to non-Hispanic Whites (adjOR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.6), and that this increased risk is more pronounced among Hispanic or Latino persons (adjOR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.1). However, we did not find differences in the duration of symptoms nor type of symptom presentation between non-Hispanic White and non-White individuals. We found that risk of hospitalization increases with age (adjOR=6.9 95% CI: 2.1, 22.5 for age 60+ compared to 0-19), and additionally show that younger individuals (aged 0-19), were underrepresented both in overall rates of testing as well as rates of testing positive. We did not find major race\/ethnic differences in hospitalization rates. In this analysis of predominantly non-hospitalized individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, enabled by expansive testing capacity, we found disparities in both testing and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by race\/ethnicity and by age. Further work on addressing racial and ethnic disparities, particularly among Hispanic\/Latino communities (where SARS-CoV-2 may be spreading more rapidly due to increased exposure and comparatively reduced testing), will be needed to effectively combat COVID-19 in the US.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sharia M Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Rashmee U Shah","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Margaret Bale","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jordan B Peacock","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ben Berger","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Brown","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.

This has hampered the ability to ascertain true infection numbers, evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance strategies, determine transmission dynamics, and estimate reproductive numbers. Leveraging both viral genomic and time series case data offers methods to estimate these parameters. Using a Bayesian inference framework to fit a branching process model to viral phylogeny and time series case data, we estimated time-varying reproductive numbers and their variance, the total numbers of infected individuals, the probability of case detection over time, and the estimated time to detection of an outbreak for 12 locations in Europe, China, and the United States. The median percentage of undetected infections ranged from 13% in New York to 92% in Shanghai, China, with the length of local transmission prior to two cases being detected ranging from 11 days (95% CI: 4-21) in California to 37 days (9-100) in Minnesota. The probability of detection was as low as 1% at the start of local epidemics, increasing as the number of reported cases increased exponentially. The precision of estimates increased with the number of full-length viral genomes in a location. The viral phylogeny was informative of the variance in the reproductive number with the 32% most infectious individuals contributing 80% of total transmission events. This is the first study that incorporates both the viral genomes and time series case data in the estimation of undetected COVID-19 infections. Our findings suggest the presence of undetected infections broadly and that superspreading events are contributing less to observed dynamics than during the SARS epidemic in 2003. This genomics-informed modeling approach could estimate in near real-time critical surveillance metrics to inform ongoing COVID-19 response efforts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy M Li","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Patrick Ayscue","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Margaret Bale","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jordan B Peacock","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ben Berger","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Brown","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.

We consider a divide and conquer strategy in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below the critical value of R_eff < 1 without further lockdown once the HRG is released from isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that R_eff < 1 can only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than ~20-30% of the total population. Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of the lockdown is estimated to be {tau} ~ 14 days\/(1-R_eff) (up to some order one factor) for R_eff < 1, provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why R_eff remains the crucial parameter which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick S.

Using the UK as a case study, we construct a stochastic branching process model for the virus transmission, embedded on a network interaction model encoding mobility patterns in the UK. The network model is based on commuter data from the 2011 census, a catchment area model for schools, and a phenomenological model for mobility and interactions outside of work, school, and the home. We show that for outbreak scenarios where contact-tracing and moderate social distancing alone provide suppression but do not contain the spread, targeted lockdowns or mass-testing interventions at the level of individual communities (with just a few thousand inhabitants) can be effective at containing outbreaks. For spatially targeted mass-testing, a moderate increase in testing capacity would be required (typically < 40000 additional tests per day), while for local lockdowns we find that only a small fraction (typically < 0.1%) of the population needs to be locked down at any one time (assuming that one third of transmission occurs in the home, at work or school, and out in the wider community respectively). The efficacy of spatially targeted interventions is contingent on an appreciable fraction of transmission events occurring within (relative to across) communities. Confirming the efficacy of community-level interventions therefore calls for detailed investigation of spatial transmission patterns for SARS-CoV-2, accounting for sub-community-scale transmission dynamics, and changes in mobility patterns due to the presence of other containment measures (such as social distancing and travel restrictions).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Alsing","author_inst":"Oskar Klein Centre, Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Nairi Usher","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Philip JD Crowley","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Jordan B Peacock","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ben Berger","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Brown","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.

To explore how interactions among such \"essential\" workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several models of essential worker interactions within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of, respectively, cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent interaction controls on the rest of the population in order to manage the pandemic. However, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic, highlighting the need to understand and target for intervention the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William R Milligan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Zachary L Fuller","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ipsita Agarwal","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael B Eisen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Molly Przeworski","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Guy Sella","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sara Mann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"William West","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Martin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Valerie Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sara Grineski","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H.

Consequently, countries have adopted physical distance measures in an attempt to mitigate the uncontrolled spread of the virus. A critical question for policymakers to inform evidence-based practice is if and how physical distance measures slowed the propagation of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. Methods This study aims to quantify the effects of physical distance mitigation measures on the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from John Hopkins University on confirmed cases and testing data from the Our World in Data were used in an interrupted time series analysis to estimate the effects of physical distance measures on the growth rates of the pandemic in 12 countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Findings We found that physical distance measures produced a significant decrease in the growth rates of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Malaysia, and South Korea). The test-positivity rate was significant in understanding the slowing growth rate of COVID-19 cases caused by the mitigation measures, as it provides important context that is missing from analysis based only on confirmed case data. Interpretation Physical distance interventions effectively slowed the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study could inform infectious disease mitigation policies based on physical distance measures by quantifying the differential health outcomes of a pandemic with and without physical distance interventions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Esteban Correa-Agudelo","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Hana Kim","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Adam J Branscum","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"F.

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. Preliminary findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. In particular, large decreases in the amount of social activity through family (58%), friends\/neighbors (44.9%) or entertainment (46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower satisfaction (-30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, social contact score through digital technologies has significantly increased (p<0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period. Therefore, in order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through technology-based solution is urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ACHRAF AMMAR","author_inst":"Otto-Von-Guericke University"},{"author_name":"Hamdi Chtourou","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Boukhris","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Khaled Trabelsi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.

This work aims to develop valid instruments to evaluate COVID-19 induced anxiety, protective behaviors, and knowledge towards COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between the three constructs. Methods: A total sample of 215 university students were recruited to participate in an online self-administered questionnaire. The e-survey consisted of three instruments: COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) with 10 items, Protective Behaviors towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) with 14 items, and COVID-19 Related Knowledge Scale (CRKS) with 12 items. Results: Item-total analysis and CFA models indicated that CIAS items no. 1, 2, 5, and 8 should be removed to achieve adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.78) and structural validity. The protective behaviors towards COVID-19 can be estimated from 3 dimensions: Routine Protective Behaviors (RPB), Post-exposure Protective Behaviors (PPB), and Post-exposure Risky Behaviors (PRB). Meanwhile, PBCS showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=0.85). Although the sample was unbalanced on gender, gender explained 5% of the variance in protective behaviors with females being more inclined to engage in protective behaviors. Structural Equation Model (SEM) implied that an individual's COVID-19 related knowledge was associated with the three dimensions of protective behaviors (RPB, PPB, and PRB) positively. However, the level of COVID-19 induced anxiety was linked to RPB and PPB positively but negatively to PRB. Conclusion: The 6-item version of CIAS and the 14-item version of PBCS are promising tools for measuring COVID-19 induced anxiety and protective behaviors and can be adopted for future use during early phases of communicable diseases outbreaks. Knowledge is a key indicator for protective behavior; therefore, awareness strategies need to suppress infodemic impact. Severe stress must be monitored during early phases of outbreaks as it significantly increases the probability of risk behavior engagement.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abanoub Riad","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Yi Huang","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Liping Zheng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Steriani Elavsky","author_inst":"Masaryk University"},{"author_name":"Liwa Masmoudi","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Michael Brach","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Ellen Bentlage","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniella How","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mona Ahmed","author_inst":"Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Munster, Germany"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Notger Mueller","author_inst":"Research Group Neuroprotection, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Asma Aloui","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Omar Hammouda","author_inst":"High Institute of Sport and Physical Education of Sfax, 3000, Sfax, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Laisa Liane Paineiras-Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Annemarie Braakman-jansen","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Christian Wrede","author_inst":"University of Twente, the Netherlands Region de Enschede, Netherland"},{"author_name":"Sophia Bastoni","author_inst":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart I UNICATT, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlos Soares Pernambuco","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Mataruna","author_inst":"College of Business Administration, American University in the Emirates, Dubai, UAE"},{"author_name":"Morteza Taheri","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Khadijeh Irandoust","author_inst":"Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran"},{"author_name":"Aimen Khacharem","author_inst":"UVHC, DeVisu, Valenciennes, France; LIRTES - EA 7313.
