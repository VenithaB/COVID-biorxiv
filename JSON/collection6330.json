Neutrophil activation seems to be crucial in the initiation and perpetuation of this exacerbated lung inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms by which this activation occurs remain yet elusive. To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients.\n\nHighlightsO_LINine potential PIPs were predicted exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 PIPs showed homology against T cell recognition epitopes.\nC_LIO_LIMost of PIPs were produced by enzymatic cleavage of the spike glycoproteins.\nC_LIO_LIThe release of these PIPs might be related to the increased inflammatory response observed in the patients.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=189 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/072439v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd2c3forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113f8b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2df78eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7c946_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aitor Blanco-Miguez","author_inst":"University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Borja Sanchez","author_inst":"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Centificas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.073387","rel_title":"PSGL-1 blocks SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated virus attachment and infection of target cells","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.073387","rel_abs":"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that binds to P-, E-, and L-selectins to mediate the tethering and rolling of immune cells on the surface of the endothelium for cell migration into inflamed tissues.

Here we report that the expression of PSGL-1 in virus-producing cells impairs the incorporation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoproteins into pseudovirions and blocks virus attachment and infection of target cells.

COVID-19 is highly infectious and with high mortality rate. As no effective antiviral treatment is currently available, new drugs are urgently needed. We employed transcriptional analysis to uncover potential antiviral drugs from natural products or FDA approved drugs. We found liquiritin significantly inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC50 = 2.39 M. Mechanistically, we found liquiritin exerts anti-viral function by mimicking type I interferon. Upregulated genes induced by liquiritin are enriched in GO categories including type I interferon signaling pathway, negative regulation of viral genome replication and etc. In toxicity experiment, no death was observed when treated at dose of 300 mg\/kg for a week in ICR mice. All the organ indexes but liver and serum biochemical indexes were normal after treatment. Liquiritin is abundant in licorice tablet (~0.2% by mass), a traditional Chinese medicine. Together, we recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating COVID-19. We also expect liquiritin to have a broad and potent antiviral function to other viral pathogens, like HBV, HIV and etc.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Feng Li","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Na-Na Zhang","author_inst":"Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zurui Liu","author_inst":"Gigaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Bowen Zhang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zhengwei Xie","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.071811","rel_title":"Structural and Functional Implications of Non-synonymous Mutations in the Spike protein of 2,954 SARS-CoV-2 Genomes","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.071811","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein with the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is pivotal for attachment and entry of the virus. Yet, natural mutations acquired on S protein during the pandemic and their impact on viral infectivity, transmission dynamics and disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 2952 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified a total of 1815 non-synonymous mutations in the S-protein that fall into 54 different types. We observed that six of these distinct mutations were located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region that directly engages host ACE2. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that these RBD mutations cluster into distinct phyletic clades among global subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 implying possible emergence of novel sublineages of the strain. Structure-guided homology modelling and docking analysis predicted key molecular rearrangements in the ACE2 binding interface of RBD mutants that could result in altered virus-host interactions. We propose that our findings could be significant in understanding disease dynamics and in developing vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics for COVID-19.\n\nImportanceCOVID-19 pandemic shows considerable variations in disease transmission and pathogenesis globally, yet reasons remain unknown. Our study identifies key S-protein mutations prevailing in SARS-CoV-2 strain that could alter viral attachment and infectivity. We propose that the interplay of these mutations could be one of the factors driving global variations in COVID-19 spread. In addition, the mutations identified in this study could be an important indicator in predicting efficacies of vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics that target SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 interface.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shijulal Nelson-Sathi","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Perunthottathu K Umasankar","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sreekumar Easwaran","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Radhakrishnan R Nair","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnolgoy"},{"author_name":"Iype Joseph","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sai Ravi Chandra Nori","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.071050","rel_title":"CoV-Seq: SARS-CoV-2 Genome Analysis and Visualization","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.071050","rel_abs":"SummaryCOVID-19 has become a global pandemic not long after its inception in late 2019.

Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In order to address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, a webserver to enable simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shing Hei Zhan","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E Deverman","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Yulia Alina Chan","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Bian","author_inst":"Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, USA"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082669","rel_title":"Mental Health of Clinical Staff Working in High-Risk Epidemic and Pandemic Health Emergencies: A Rapid Review of the Evidence and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082669","rel_abs":"The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 \/ COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vaughan Bell","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Dorothy Wade","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals Critical Care Department"},{"author_name":"Yulia Alina Chan","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuchen Bian","author_inst":"Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, USA"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083667","rel_title":"Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083667","rel_abs":"Although some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on individual mental health is still nascent.

We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001).

Fomsgaard et al 2020 recently presented results using heat-processing of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this technique. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes based on the above study to optimise the heat-treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed the published results, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used virus transport media (VTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, emphasising the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most adapted reagents to be used depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, although the method works, with very consistent Ct values and an excellent sensitivity when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method, it is critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronan MM Calvez","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Andrew Taylor","author_inst":"Micropatholgy Ltd"},{"author_name":"Leonides Calvo-Bado","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Colin G Fink","author_inst":"Micropathology Ltd"},{"author_name":"Artur Paiva Coutinho","author_inst":"UFPE"},{"author_name":"Liang Huang","author_inst":"School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330, USA"},{"author_name":"Jamiema Sara Philip","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Roshny Prasad","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kolaparamba V Navyasree","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shikha Ramesh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Heera Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sanu Gosh","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Santhosh Kumar TR","author_inst":"RajiV Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"M Radhakrishna Pillai","author_inst":"Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083113","rel_title":"The Chronic Kidney Disease and Acute Kidney Injury Involvement in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083113","rel_abs":"Aim: The aim of this study was to uncover whether kidney diseases were involved in COVID-19 pandemic from a systematic review.

Results: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that the comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 3.28), complication of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) was significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in critical group than that in severe group. Conclusion: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients.

Methods: In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurological patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. Results: 173 patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older, had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders, and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (all p<0.05). In-hospital mortality rates and incident delirium were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (all p<0.005). COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge, with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (all p<0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (odds ratio 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p=0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p=0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p=0.009) on admission. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pilotto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Premi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Libri","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agosti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Antonella Alberici","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Enrico Baldelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20085860","rel_title":"Coding variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not major drivers of COVID-19 severity in UK Biobank subjects.","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20085860","rel_abs":"It is plausible that variants in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes might contribute to variation in COVID-19 severity and that these could explain why some people become very unwell whereas most do not.

There were no statistically significant differences in weighted burden scores between cases and controls for either gene. There were no individual DNA sequence variants with a markedly different frequency between cases and controls. Whether there are small effects on severity, or whether there might be rare variants with major effect sizes, would require studies in much larger samples.

In response, many health systems have chosen to restrict access to surgery and reallocate resources; the impact on the provision of surgical services has been profound, with huge numbers of patient now awaiting surgery at the risk of avoidable harm. The challenge now is how do hospitals transition from the current pandemic mode of operation back to business as usual, and ensure that all patients receive equitable, timely and high-quality surgical care during all phases of the public health crisis. Aims and Methods This case study takes carotid endarterectomy as a time-sensitive surgical procedure and simulates 400 compartmental demand modelling scenarios for managing surgical capacity in the UK for two years following the pandemic. Results A total of 7,69 patients will require carotid endarterectomy. In the worst-case scenario, if no additional capacity is provided on resumption of normal service, the waiting list may never be cleared, and no patient will receive surgery within the 2-week target; potentially leading to >1000 avoidable strokes. If surgical capacity is doubled after 1-month of resuming normal service, it will still take more than 6-months to clear the backlog, and 30.8% of patients will not undergo surgery within 2-weeks, with an average wait of 20.3 days for the proceeding 2 years. Conclusions This case study for carotid endarterectomy has shown that every healthcare system is going to have to make difficult decisions for balancing human and capital resources against the needs of patients. It has demonstrated that the timing and size of this effort will critically influence the ability of these systems to return to their baseline and continue to provide the highest quality care for all. The failure to sustainably increase surgical capacity early in the post-COVID-19 period will have significant long-term negative impacts on patients and is likely to result in avoidable harm.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Carter","author_inst":"London School of Economics & Political Science"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ara Darzi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"PanSurg Collaborative","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084475","rel_title":"Reduced COVID-19-Related Critical Illness and Death, and High Risk of Epidemic Resurgence, After Physical Distancing in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084475","rel_abs":"We explored the impact of physical distancing measures on COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada using a previously described age- and health-status stratified transmission model. The model was fit to confirmed cases occupying intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 cases for the time period 19 March to 26 April 2020. We projected that mortality would have been 4.6-fold what was observed had physical distancing measures not been implemented in the province. Relaxation of physical distancing measures without compensatory increases in case detection, isolation, and\/or contact tracing was projected to result in resurgence of disease activity. Return to normal or near-normal levels of contact would rapidly result in cases exceeding ICU capacity. Maintaining physical distancing for a longer period of time, allowing for the initial wave of infections to subside, delayed this resurgence, but the level of contacts post-restrictive distancing was the major factor determining how quickly ICU capacity was expected to be overwhelmed. Using a model, we demonstrate the marked impact strong public health measures had in reducing ICU admissions and mortality in Ontario. We also show that this hard-earned success is tenuous: relaxation of physical distancing measures in the near-term is projected to result in a rapid resurgence of disease activity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Steven De Keninck","author_inst":"Matrix Factory bvba"},{"author_name":"David N Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ara Darzi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"PanSurg Collaborative","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084863","rel_title":"Inflammatory markers in Covid-19 Patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084863","rel_abs":"Introduction Diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestation, history of exposure, positive findings on chest CT and laboratory tests.

Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not being conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Yet these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and to thus appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to better understand the state and dynamics of the pandemic. Methods: In 100, randomly selected constituencies out of 755, 3,000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects [&ge;]14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of [&le;]3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children <14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. Discussion: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic effects. This will support policy makers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katja Radon","author_inst":"Center for International Health and Institute for Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich"},{"author_name":"Elmar Saathoff","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Mun"},{"author_name":"Michael Pritsch","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jessica Michelle Guggenbuehl Noller","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Inge Kroidl","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Mun"},{"author_name":"Laura Olbrich","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Verena Thiel","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Diefenbach","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Friedrich Riess","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Felix Forster","author_inst":"Institute and Outpatient Clinic for Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) University Hospital Munich"},{"author_name":"Fabian J Theis","author_inst":"Helmholtz Center Munich and Departments of Mathematics and Life Sciences, Technical University of Munich"},{"author_name":"Andreas Wieser","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Faculty of Medicine, LMU of Mu"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich;

Methods A total of 56 COVID-19 patients without symptoms at admission and 19 age-matched symptomatic patients were enrolled. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was tested using transcriptase quantitative PCR, and the total antibodies (Ab), IgG, IgA and IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 were tested using Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immuno Assay. Results Among 56 patients without symptoms at admission, 33 cases displayed symptoms and 23 remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. 43.8% of the asymptomatic carriers were children and none of the asymptomatic cases had recognizable changes in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6, except one 64-year-old patient. The initial threshold cycle value of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers was similar to that in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients, but the communicable period of asymptomatic carriers (9.63 days) was shorter than pre-symptomatic patients (13.6 days). There was no obvious differences of the seropositive conversion rate of total Ab, IgG, and IgA among the three groups, though the rates of IgM varied largely. The average peak IgG and IgM COI of asymptomatic cases was 3.5 and 0.8, respectively, which is also lower than those in symptomatic patients with peaked IgG and IgM COI of 4.5 and 2.4 (p <0.05). Conclusion Young COVID-19 patients seem to be asymptomatic cases with early clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and low levels of IgM generation but high total Ab, IgG and IgA. Our findings provide empirical information for viral clearance and antibody kinetics of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tongyang Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanrong Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haocheng Ye","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lanlan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shen Qian","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Wieser","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, Germany and Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Faculty of Medicine, LMU of Mu"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelscher","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich; Center for International Health, LMU of Munich and German Center for Infe"},{"author_name":"KoCo19 collaboration group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Invernizzi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ugo Leggio","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Foundation IRCCS Neurological Institute Carlo Besta"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Raffaella Spezi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"ASST Spedali Civili"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083691","rel_title":"Ultra-Sensitive High-Resolution Profiling of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies for Detecting Early Seroconversion in COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083691","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect millions of people worldwide.

This multiplexed assay format allows us to quantitate IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins against four SARS-CoV-2 targets, thereby interrogating 12 antibody isotype-viral protein interactions to give a high resolution profile of the immune response. Using a cohort of samples collected prior to the outbreak as well as samples collected during the pandemic, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection, and 100% sensitivity and specificity thereafter.

SARS-CoV-2 is novel to most parts of the world including USA and the effect on normally prevalent viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March, 2020. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at BSWH, Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time RT-PCR assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. Results: More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1,659 ED\/inpatients were tested positive. Higher rate of infection (6.9%) were noted in the patients belonging to age group 25-34 years and least number of positive cases were noted in <25 years old (2%) group. The TX State county specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a sudden decrease in the occurrence of other infections due to seasonal viruses, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness, about SARS-CoV-2, among general public. Authors would also like to share a small study on SARS-CoV-2 serological assay for the detection of IgG antibodies. Conclusions: This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manohar B Mutnal","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Alejandro C Arroliga","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Walker","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Amin A Mohammad","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew M Brigmon","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Ryan M Beaver","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"John K Midturi","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Arundhati Rao","author_inst":"Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, Temple TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Blake M.

Serology testing is important for diagnosis of infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of investigating new immunogens NSP1, ORF3b, ORF7a and ORF8 which may mediate immune functions other than neutralization which may be beneficial or harmful to the patient.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Hachim","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Niloufar Kavian","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Carolyn A Cohen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alex WH Chin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Daniel KW Chu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Owen TY Tsang","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hospital Authority of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yiu Cheong Yeung","author_inst":"Princess Margaret Hospital, Hospital Authority of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ranawaka APM Perera","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Leo LM Poon","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik JS Peiris","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sophie A Valkenburg","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH"},{"author_name":"Richelle C.

The nasal and lower conducting airways have similar cell composition and nasal transcriptomes identify disease state and sub-classes in lung cancer, COPD, and asthma. We conducted an observational, prospective trial to determine whether this technique could identify PARDS endotypes in 26 control and 25 PARDS subjects <18 admitted to the pediatric ICU. RNA from inferior turbinate brushing was collected on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Standard RNA-processing yielded 29% usable specimens by mRNA-Seq, and a low-input protocol increased yield to 95% usable specimens. 64 low-input specimens from 10 control and 15 PARDS subjects were used for model development. Control and some PARDS subjects clustered together in Group A while some day 1, 3, and 7 specimens clustered into Groups B and C with specimens from these subjects moving to Group A with PARDS resolution. In multivariate analysis, the only clinical variables associated with specimen Group B or C assignment was severity of lung injury or viral PARDS trigger. Compared to Group A, Group B had upregulation of innate immune processes and Group C had upregulation of ciliary and microtuble processes. Analysis of the 15 standard processing specimens identified the same grouping. Mortality trended higher in group B (25%) and C subjects (28.6%) compared to A (5%, p=0.1). Comparison of groups with 16 PARDS-associated serum biomarkers identified correlation of Endotype B with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, but not other inflammatory cytokines and Endotype C with Surfactant Protein D. We identified three nasal transcriptomic PARDS endotypes. A is similar to control. B is marked by an innate immune signature only weakly reflected in the serum. C may be associated with loss of epithelial barrier integrity. Nasal transcriptomics may be useful for prognostic and predictive enrichment in future PARDS trials.

An appropriate immune response mediates protection, whereas an overwhelming immune response has been associated with immune-mediated pathogenesis in viral infections. The current study explored the general and SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral immune status in patients with different COVID-19 severities. Methods: In this prospective study, we included 53 patients with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 manifestations comparing their quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating immune cells, SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T-cells, and humoral immunity. Results: Significantly diminished frequencies of CD8+T-cells, CD4+ and CD8+T-cell subsets with activated differentiated memory\/effector phenotype and migratory capacity were found in circulation in patients with severe and\/or critical COVID-19 as compared to patients with moderate disease. Importantly, the improvement of the clinical courses from severe to moderate was accompanied by an improvement in the T-cell subset alterations. Furthermore, we surprisingly observed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell response in all three groups after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein overlapping peptide pool already at the first visit. Of note, patients with a critical COVID-19 demonstrated a stronger response of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells producing Th1 associated inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, clear correlation between antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ frequencies underscore the role of specific immunity in disease progression. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that depletion of activated memory phenotype circulating T-cells and a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity are associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This counter-intuitive finding may have important implications for diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz

Healthcare is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic through the fast adoption of digital solutions and advanced technology tools. The aim of this study is to describe which digital solutions have been reported in the scientific literature and to investigate their potential impact in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We conducted a literature review searching PubMed and MedrXiv with terms considered adequate to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to COVID-19. We developed an impact score to evaluate the potential impact on COVID-19 pandemic of all the digital solutions addressed in the selected papers. Results. The search identified 269 articles, of which 145 full-text articles were assessed and 124 included in the review after screening and impact evaluation. Of selected articles, most of them addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance and prevention. We report that digital solutions and innovative technologies have mainly been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial-intelligence-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are useful also for prevention and surveillance measures, for example through contact-tracing apps or monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Discussion. It is worth taking advantage of the push given by the crisis, and mandatory to keep track of the digital solutions proposed today to implement tomorrow's best practices and models of care, and to be ready for any new moments of emergency.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Golinelli","author_inst":"DIBINEM, University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Erik

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Netherlands, 3.9% of healthcare workers (HCWs) in nine hospitals located in the South of the Netherlands tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The extent of nosocomial transmission that contributed to the HCW infections was unknown. Methods: We combined epidemiological data, collected by means of structured interviews of HCWs, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples from HCWs and patients in three of nine hospitals that participated in the HCW screening, to perform an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in HCWs and patients. Results: A total of 1,796 out of 12,022 HCWs (15%) of the three participating hospitals were screened, based on clinical symptoms, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete genome sequences of 50 HCWs and 18 patients. Most sequences grouped in 3 clusters, with 2 clusters displaying local circulation within the region. The observed patterns are most consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community acquired infections, and local amplification in the community. Conclusions: Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, the data does not support widespread nosocomial transmission as source of infection in patients or healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Suzan Pas","author_inst":"Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Bravis Hospital, Roosendaal\/ Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Amphia Hospital, Breda"},{"author_name":"David F.

Japan is known to have relatively less number of infections as well as deaths among developed nations. However, accurate prevalence of COVID-19 in Japan remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using 1,000 samples from patients at outpatient settings who visited the clinic from March 31 to April 7, 2020, stratified by decade of age and sex. Results There were 33 positive IgG among 1,000 serum samples (3.3%, 95%CI: 2.3-4.6%). By applying this figure to the census of Kobe City (poplation: 1,518,870), it is estimated that the number of people with positive IgG be 50,123 (95%CI: 34,934-69,868). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of positivity was 2.7% (95%CI 1.8-3.9%), and the estimated number of people with positive IgG was 40,999 (95%CI: 27,333-59,221). These numbers were 396 to 858 fold more than confirmed cases with PCR testing in Kobe City. Conclusions Our cross-sectional serological study suggests that the number of people with seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kobe, Japan is far more than the confirmed cases by PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asako Doi","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Iwata","author_inst":"Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hirokazu Kuroda","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshikazu Hasuike","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Seiko Nasu","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aya Kanda","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tomomi Nagao","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroaki Nishioka","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Tomii","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Morimoto","author_inst":"Hyogo Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yasuki Kihara","author_inst":"Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ronald J Overmars","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Stefan van Nieuwkoop","author_inst":"Viroscience, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Wouter van den Bijllaardt","author_inst":"Microvida Laboratory for Microbiology, Amphia Hospital, Breda"},{"author_name":"Robbert G.
