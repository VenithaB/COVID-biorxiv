Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and\/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-{beta}2GPI) and anti-phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (aPS\/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies was not reported. Objective. To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies. Methods. ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events. Results. Anti-{beta}2GPI IgG\/IgA\/IgM were the most frequent in 15.6\/6.6\/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG\/IgM were detected in 5.7\/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by chemiluminescence. aPS\/PT IgG\/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association between thrombosis and aPL was found. Reactivity against domain 1 and 4-5 of {beta}2GPI was limited to 3\/58 (5.2%) tested sera for each domain and did not correlate with aCL\/anti-{beta}2GPI nor with thrombosis. Conclusions. aPL show a low prevalence in COVID-19 patients and are not associated with major thrombotic events. aPL in COVID-19 patients are mainly directed against {beta}2GPI but display an epitope specificity different from antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Orietta Borghi","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano - Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Beltagy","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Emirena Garrafa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Curreli","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germana Cecchini","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Chemical Chemistry, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Bodio","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Grossi","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simonetta Blengino","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Angela Tincani","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Dep.

A special interest of simulations on the pandemic is to trace the effect of politics for reducing the virus spread, since these measures have had an enormous impact on economy and daily life. Here a simple yet powerful algorithm is introduced for fitting the infection numbers by simple analytic functions. This way, the increase of the case numbers in periods with different regulations can be distinguished, and by extrapolating the fit functions, a forecast for the maximum numbers and time scales are possible. The effect of the restraints such as lock down are demonstrated by comparing the resulting infection history with the likely unconstrained virus spread, and it is shown that a delay of 1-4 weeks before imposing measures aiming at social distancing could have led to a complete infection of the respective populations. The approach is simply transferable to many different states. Here data from six E.U. countries, the UK, Russia, two Asian countries, the USA and ten states inside the USA with significant case numbers are analyzed, and striking qualitative similarities are found.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Walter Langel","author_inst":"University of Greifswald"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Beltagy","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Emirena Garrafa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniele Curreli","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Germana Cecchini","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Chemical Chemistry, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Bodio","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Grossi","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simonetta Blengino","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Department of Cardiovascular, Neural and Metabolic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Angela Tincani","author_inst":"Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Dep.

Most COVID-19 cases published were in the third trimester of pregnancy, which could reflect reporting bias, higher risk of infection or increased disease severity in late pregnancy. Seroprevalence studies may allow reliable estimates of the susceptibility to infection and clinical spectrum since they include asymptomatic and mild infections not tested for PCR. We evaluated the seroprevalence and clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women in the first and third trimester. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution and informed consent was obtained. We recruited 874 consecutive pregnancies attending for first trimester screening (10-16 weeks of gestation, n=372) or delivery (n=502) from April 14 to May 5. All women were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms two months prior to sampling. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM\/IgA antibodies were tested (COVID-19 VIRCLIA Monotest, Vircell Microbiologist, Spain; reported sensitivity 70% IgG and 89% IgM\/IgA, and specificity 89% and 99% respectively). Indeterminate results were re-tested (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV2 Total Tests, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA; 100% sensitivity and specificity) and re-classified as positive or negative. Women with COVID-19 were diagnosed and managed according to standard protocols and guidelines3,4. Statistical differences were tested using the {chi}2 test or Student t-test as appropriate (p<0.05). Results: A total of 125 of 874 women (14.3%) were positive for either IgG or IgM\/IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 54\/372 (14.5%) in the first and 71\/502 (14.1%) in the third trimester. A total of 75\/125 (60%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, whereas 44 (35.2%) reported one or more symptoms, of which 31 (24.8%) had at least 3 symptoms or anosmia and 8 (6.4%) dyspnea. Overall, 7 women (5.6%) were admitted for persistent fever despite paracetamol and dyspnea, of which 3 had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. All 3 had criteria for severity (bilateral chest condensation, respiratory rate>30 and leukopenia) and required oxygen support but not critical care or mechanical ventilation, and they were all discharged well. The rates of symptomatic infection, hospital admission or dyspnea were significantly higher in third trimester women (Table and Figure). Discussion: The 14.3% seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women in this study was substantially larger than the contemporary rates of PCR positive cases (0.78%) reported for women 20-40y in Barcelona. The data confirm that COVID-19 is asymptomatic in the majority of pregnant women6 and illustrate the value of seroprevalence studies to capture the high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections. In this study, none of the 125 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection required critical care as compared to 9% reported in cases diagnosed with PCR. However, the proportion of infections with symptoms or dyspnea was remarkably higher in the third trimester, and these results are in line with COVID-19 registries, reporting that 81% of hospitalized women were in late pregnancy or peripartum. These results provide reassuring information that, even in settings with a high prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy mostly presents with asymptomatic or mild clinical forms. The susceptibility to infection seemed to be the same in the first and the third trimesters of gestation. The data further suggest that, as with other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 could be more severe and require increased surveillance in late pregnancy. These findings should be confirmed and extended with larger consecutive prevalence studies in pregnancy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesca Crovetto","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, IDIBA"},{"author_name":"Fatima Crispi","author_inst":"BCNatal (Hospital Clinic and Sant Joan de Deu), IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Elisa Llurba","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Sant Pau University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francesc Figueras","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, CIBERER,"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Gomez-Roig","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, Unive"},{"author_name":"Eduard Gratacos","author_inst":"BCNatal - Barcelona Center for Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Sant Joan de Deu and Hospital Clinic), Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, IDIBA"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Schwab","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maurice Henkel","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Angela Frank","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Veronika Zsikla","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Niels Willi","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner Kempf","author_inst":"Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hoyler","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mattia Barbareschi","author_inst":"Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Ospedale S.

Olfactory impairment is now a recognized symptom of COVID-19 and is rapidly becoming one of the most reliable indicators of the disease. We compared olfaction data from asymptomatic students, who were assessed as SARS-CoV-2 was unknowingly spreading locally, to students tested prior to the arrival of the virus. This study was naturalistic by design as testing occurred in the context of four research studies, all of which used the same inclusion\/exclusion criteria and the same protocol to objectively assess odor detection, identification, and hedonics with physiological tests. Data from students (Cohort II; N=22) with probable SARS-CoV-2 exposure were compared to students tested just prior to local virus transmission (Cohort I; N=25), and a normative sample of students assessed over the previous four years (N=272). Students in Cohort II demonstrated significantly reduced odor detection sensitivity compared to students in Cohort I (t=2.60; P=.01; d=0.77; CI, 0.17, 1.36), with a distribution skewed towards reduced detection sensitivity (D=0.38; P=.005). Categorically, the exposed group was significantly more likely to have hyposmia (OR=7.74; CI, 3.1, 19.40), particularly the subgroup assessed in the final week before campus closure (OR=13.61; CI, 3.40, 35.66;). The exposed cohort also rated odors as less unpleasant (P<.001, CLES=0.77). A limitation of our study is that participants were not tested for COVID-19 as testing was unavailable in the area. Objective measures of olfaction may detect olfactory impairment in asymptomatic persons who are otherwise unaware of smell loss. The development of cost-effective, objective olfaction tests that could be self-administered regularly could aid in early detection of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which is vital to combating this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julie Walsh-Messinger","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Sahar Kaouk","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Hannah Manis","author_inst":"University of Dayton"},{"author_name":"Rachel Kaye","author_inst":"Rutgers New Jersey Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Cecchi","author_inst":"Thomas J.

Thus, our goal is to recognize endothelial activation and pyroptosis in lung and myocardial samples of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and compare to H1N1pdm09 and control cases. Approach and Results: Post-mortem lung (6 cases of COVID-19 group; 10 cases of H1N1 group and 11 cases of Control group) and myocardial samples (2 cases of COVID-19 and one control) were analyzed by conventional immunohistochemistry by using antibodies to identify molecules involving with endothelial activation (CD163, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1)) and pyroptosis (Caspase-1). As a result, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and Caspase-1 show higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and Control groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the vascular endothelium has been activated and the presence of pyroptosis and endothelial dysfunction in lung and myocardial samples. These conditions could lead to a systemic immune-thrombotic process that may impair the clinical staff's efforts to prevent fatal outcomes. One aim of the health professionals is to avoid COVID-19 systemic vascular injury and immune-thrombosis by blocking the endothelial dysfunction and its consequences.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seigo Nagashima","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Monalisa Castilho Mendes","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula Camargo Martins","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Henrique Borges","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Thiago Mateus Godoy","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Anna Flavia Miggiolaro Ribeiro","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Felipe da Silva Deziderio","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Lucia de Noronha","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Cleber Machado-Souza","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"},{"author_name":"Veronika Zsikla","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Niels Willi","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner Kempf","author_inst":"Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hoyler","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mattia Barbareschi","author_inst":"Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Ospedale S.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its control efforts require social actions and behaviours, all of which place a large reliance on individual and community compliance, highlighting the need for appropriate community engagement to support such work. However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities within COVID-19 thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation of community engagement within COVID-19 response. Methodology A rapid evidence review was conducted to identity how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases (PubMed, CINHAL and Scopus) were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS and H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language, though articles must have detailed a minimum of one community engagement for infection prevention and control initiative. All authors participated in searching, screening, and data extraction, with a minimum of two authors at each stage. Results From 1,112 references identified in our search, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria. All but 3 articles were published on or after 2015 which details 37 community engagement initiatives for Ebola (n=28), Zika (n=5) and H1N1 (n=4). Twenty-seven of these initiatives were implemented in low-income countries and 10 from high-income countries. Six broad community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility or community health committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These actors worked across six different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust-building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. Leaders were the most prevalent actor being engaged, and behaviour change communication, risk communication, and surveillance and tracing were the most common function of community engagement. Implementation considerations community engagement in prevention and control of COVID-19 are reported within. Conclusion COVID-19 global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and support equity-informed responses. Previous experience from outbreaks shows that community engagement can take many forms and include different actors and approaches who support various prevention and control activities. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures, and utilise community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brynne Gilmore","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Rawlance Ndejjo","author_inst":"2 Department of Disease Control and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda."},{"author_name":"Adalbert Tchetchia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Expanded Programme on Immunization, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Vergil de Claro","author_inst":"RTI International, Pasig, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Nyamupachitu-Mago","author_inst":"Brandeis University, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Alpha A Diallo","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Claudia Abreu Lopes","author_inst":"United Nations University, International Institute for Global Health, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sanghita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Public Health Foundation of India, Haryana, India"},{"author_name":"Cleber Machado-Souza","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"},{"author_name":"Veronika Zsikla","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Niels Willi","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner Kempf","author_inst":"Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hoyler","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mattia Barbareschi","author_inst":"Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Ospedale S.

This report from week 1 of the survey aims to (1) provide information relevant for those supporting this population; (2) identify groups currently under-represented in the survey. Methods: Women living in the UK aged [&ge;]18 years with an infant [&le;]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https:\/\/is.gd\/covid19newmumstudy). Information\/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. Results: Between May 27th and June 3rd 2020, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married\/with partner, 66% degree\/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered before lockdown (BL) and 316 (23%) during lockdown (DL). Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p<0.001) and 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed or mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p<0.05). Thirteen % reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient support with feeding. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL\/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%\/9% contacted a mental health professional and 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact and support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby.

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that elicit immunomodulatory effects and had shown in vitro antiviral effects against SRAS-CoV-2. This drug divided opinion worldwide in the medical community but also in the press, the general public and in public health policies. The aim of this systematic review and this meta-analysis was to bring a new overview on this controversial drug and to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could reduce COVID-19 mortality risk in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and grey literature were searched until 10 June 2020. Only studies of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) compared with a comparative standard care group and with full-text articles in English were included. Studies reporting effect sizes as Odds Ratios, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk for mortality risk and the number of deaths per groups were included. This meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020190801). Independent extraction has been performed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. The initial search leaded to 112 articles, from which 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. 15 studies were retained for association between hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 survival including 15,081 patients (8,072 patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 7,009 patients in the standard care arm with respectively, 1,578 deaths and 1,423 deaths). 6 studies were retained for hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality risk (pooled Relative Risk RR=0.82 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-1.07, I2=82, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=15)) within hospitalized patients, nor in association with azithromycin (pooled Relative Risk RR=1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.92, I2=75%, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=6)), nor in the numerous subgroup analysis by study design, median age population, published studies (vs unpublished articles), level of bias risk. However, stratified analysis by continents, we found a significant decreased risk of mortality associated with hydroxychlroquine alone but not with azithromycin among European (RR= 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41-0.93, n=7)) and Asian studies (RR=0.36 (95%CI:0.18-0.73, n=1)), with heterogeneity detected across continent (Pheterogeneity between=0.003). These finding should be interpreted with caution since several included studies had a low quality of evidence with a small sample size, a lack of adjustment on potential confounders or selection and intervention biases. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients. It raises the question of the hydroxychloroquine use outside of clinical trial. Additional results from larger randomised controlled trials are needed","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fiolet Thibault","author_inst":"Paris-Saclay University, INSERM U1018 (CESP)"},{"author_name":"Anthony Guihur","author_inst":"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Rebeaud","author_inst":"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Mulot","author_inst":"Laboratory of Soil Biodiversity, Faculty of Science, University of Neuchatel"},{"author_name":"Yahya Mahamat-Saleh","author_inst":"CESP, Fac. de medecine - Univ.

In this study we investigate if unemployed persons have a higher risk to become hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared with employed persons. Methods: We used routine data on hospitalizations in a study population of 1,298,416persons between the ages 18 and 65 who were enrolled in a German health insurance and who were active on the labour market (either employed or unemployed). Hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10-GM U07.1 and U07.2) were reported on a daily basis from 01.01.2020 to 04.06.2020. We studied if the rate of persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnoses differed by employment situation. Logistic regression models comparing employed with short- and long-term unemployed were calculated adjusting for age and sex. Results: In total, we observed 1,311 persons who were hospitalized, corresponding to a rate of 100.98 cases per 100.000 in our study population. Rates varied between the groups in different employment situations with lowest rates for employed and highest for long-term unemployed. Odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.84 (1.64 - 2.07) for long-term and 1.18 (0.75 - 1.85) for short-term unemployed compared with employed persons. Conclusion: The results are in line with earlier (mainly ecological) studies from the USA and Great Britain which found social inequalities in hospitalization risk. The fact that differences exist in Germany, a country with a universal health care system, indicates socioeconomic differences in the COVID-19 pandemic exists across countries.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nico Dragano","author_inst":"University Hospital Duesseldorf"},{"author_name":"Christoph J.

Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV\/RTV) is an HIV antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease. Aim of the study This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement. Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected for review from 8 electronic databases. Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically mentioned lopinavir\/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV\/RTV alone or in combination with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively. Results Non-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192 patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis. In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV\/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy (conventional) (mean difference = -0.81 day; 95% CI, -4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing LPV\/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, -1.11 to 3.01; P = 0.09, I2 = 58%). In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV\/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69). In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia\/lung damage, treatment with lopinavir\/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=45) relative to the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10 ), P = 0.004, 0,0007, respectively Conclusions The small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mansour Tobaiqy","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Saad Alhumaid","author_inst":"Drug Information and Research Department, Administration of Pharmaceutical Care, Ministry of Health, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abbas Al Mutair","author_inst":"Research Center, Dr Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Corrine Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Jessica Floyd","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Niels Willi","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Liestal, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner Kempf","author_inst":"Kempf und Pfaltz Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hoyler","author_inst":"Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mattia Barbareschi","author_inst":"Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Ospedale S.

In this study we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with non-severe (n = 21) and severe (n =19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity. Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (p=0.0087) and mortality (p=0.024). All patients harbored antibodies the second week after symptom onset that persisted for two months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilies Benotmane","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, Franc"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Gautier-Vargas","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Maris-Josee Wendling","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133389","rel_title":"A novel comprehensive metric to assess COVID-19 testing outcomes: Effects of geography, government, and policy response","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133389","rel_abs":"Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The effectiveness of testing must be tracked, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled from 0 to 100, that incorporated several testing metrics. The index was based on case-fatality rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths, testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from 188 countries and territories were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned with previous estimates in literature (R2=0.97). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest CovTI included Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Thailand, and some island nations. Globally, CovTI increased from April 20 ([x]=43.2) to June 3 ([x]=52.2) but declined in ca. 10% of countries. Bivariate analyses showed the average in countries with open public testing policies (59.7, 95% CI 55.6-63.8) were significantly higher than countries with no testing policy (30.2, 95% CI 18.1-42.3) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. This tool may be useful for policymakers to assess testing effectiveness, inform decisions, and identify model countries. It may also serve as a tool for researchers in analyses by combining it with other databases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony C Kuster","author_inst":"Faculty of Public Health, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Hans J Overgaard","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norway"},{"author_name":"Maris-Josee Wendling","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133702","rel_title":"Statistical Issues and Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Clinical Trials with Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Remdesivir","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133702","rel_abs":"Background: Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, it has rapidly spread in more than 200 countries or territories with over 8 million confirmed cases and 440,000 deaths by June 17, 2020. Recently, three randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments were completed, one for lopinavir-ritonavir and two for remdesivir. One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. However, several statistical issues in the original design and analysis of the three trials are identified, which might shed doubts on their findings and the conclusions should be evaluated with cautions. Objective: From statistical perspectives, we identify several issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. Methods: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery and adopted the bootstrap method and permutation test to construct the confidence intervals as well as the P values. The restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) was also computed as a global and robust measure for efficacy. Results: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of terminal rates was -8.74% (95% CI [-21.04, 3.55]; P=.16) and the hazards ratio (HR) adjusted for terminal rates was 1.05 (95% CI [0.78, 1.42]; P=.74), indicating no significant difference. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of terminal rates was -0.89% (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.19) and the HR adjusted for terminal rates was 0.92 (95% CI [0.63, 1.35]; P=.67). The difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained, and both conditional and unconditional prediction delivered significant HR results if the trial had continued to double the target sample size. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups up to day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles. Conclusions: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis for ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guosheng Yin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chenyang Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Jin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20134015","rel_title":"Analysis of Genetic Host Response Risk Factors in Severe COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20134015","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Epidemiological studies indicate that as many as 20% of individuals who test positive for COVID-19 develop severe symptoms that can require hospitalization. These symptoms include low platelet count, severe hypoxia, increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, severe COVID-19 is associated with several chronic co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The identification of genetic risk factors that impact differential host responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the development of severe COVID-19, is important in gaining greater understanding into the biological mechanisms underpinning life-threatening responses to the virus. These insights could be used in the identification of high-risk individuals and for the development of treatment strategies for these patients. METHODS As of June 6, 2020, there were 976 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized, indicating they had a severe response to SARS-CoV-2. There were however too few patients with a mild form of COVID-19 to use this cohort as our control population. Instead we used similar control criteria to our previous study looking at shared genetic risk factors between severe COVID-19 and sepsis, selecting controls who had not developed sepsis despite having maximum co-morbidity risk and exposure to sepsis-causing pathogens. RESULTS Using a combinatorial (high-order epistasis) analysis approach, we identified 68 protein-coding genes that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. At the time of analysis, nine of these genes have been linked to differential response to SARS-CoV-2. We also found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors. CONCLUSION The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. Among the 68 severe COVID-19 risk-associated genes, we found several druggable protein targets and pathways. Nine are targeted by drugs that have reached at least Phase I clinical trials, and a further eight have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. Several of these targets were particularly enriched in specific co-morbidities, providing insights into shared pathological mechanisms underlying both the development of severe COVID-19, ARDS and these predisposing co-morbidities. We can use these insights to identify patients who are at greatest risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and develop targeted therapeutic strategies for them, with the aim of improving disease burden and survival rates.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krystyna Taylor","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pearson","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132688","rel_title":"Assessing the impact of coordinated COVID-19 exit strategies across Europe","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132688","rel_abs":"As rates of new COVID-19 cases decline across Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing policies and lockdown measures, countries require guidance on how to ease restrictions while minimizing the risk of resurgent outbreaks.

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe. In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe meant half as many lockdown periods were required to end community transmission continent-wide.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Warren Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Jessica Floyd","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Shengjie Lai","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Corrine Warren Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Adam Sadilek","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Pedro Rente-Lourenco","author_inst":"Vodafone, Inc"},{"author_name":"Xue Ben","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carioli","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Joshua Gwinn","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Jessica Steele","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Aaron Schneider","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew Oplinger","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20131417","rel_title":"Leveraging wearable technology to predict the risk of COVID-19 infection.","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20131417","rel_abs":"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can cause shortness of breath, lung damage, and impaired respiratory function.

A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3 {+\/-} 9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included - 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while infected with something other than COVID-19). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=24 people, 320 samples) ; (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n=190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model's ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dean J Miller","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"John V Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Michele Lastella","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Charli Sargent","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Roach","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Victoria H Lee","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Emily R Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carioli","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Joshua Gwinn","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Jessica Steele","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Aaron Schneider","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew Oplinger","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132597","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and in-hospital mortality or discharge in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection: a cohort study of 4,642 in-patients in France","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132597","rel_abs":"Objective To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZI) in preventing death or leading to hospital discharge. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting An analysis of data from electronic medical records and administrative claim data from the French Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP) data warehouse, in 39 public hospitals, Ile-de-France, France. Participants All adult inpatients with at least one PCR-documented SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a nasopharyngeal sample between February 1st, 2020 and April 6th, 2020 were eligible for analysis. The study population was restricted to patients who did not receive COVID-19 treatments assessed in ongoing trials, including antivirals and immunosuppressive drugs. End of follow-up was defined as the date of death, discharge home, day 28 after admission, whichever occurred first, or administrative censoring on May 4, 2020. Intervention Patients were further classified into 3 groups: (i) receiving HCQ alone, (ii) receiving HCQ together with AZI, and (iii) receiving neither HCQ nor AZI. Exposure to a HCQ\/AZI combination was defined as a simultaneous prescription of the 2 treatments (more or less one day). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality as a time-to-event endpoint under a competing risks survival analysis framework. The secondary outcome was 28-day discharge home. Augmented inverse probability of treatment weighted (AIPTW) estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) were computed to account for confounding. Results A total of 4,642 patients (mean age: 66.1 +\/- 18; males: 2,738 (59%)) were included, of whom 623 (13.4%) received HCQ alone, 227 (5.9%) received HCQ plus AZI, and 3,792 (81.7%) neither drug. Patients receiving \"HCQ alone\" or \"HCQ plus AZI\" were more likely younger, males, current smokers and overall presented with slightly more co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes, any chronic pulmonary diseases, liver diseases), while no major difference was apparent in biological parameters. After accounting for confounding, no statistically significant difference was observed between the \"HCQ\" and \"Neither drug\" groups for 28-day mortality: AIPTW absolute difference in ATE was +1.24% (-5.63 to 8.12), ratio in ATE 1.05 (0.77 to 1.33). 28-day discharge rates were statistically significantly higher in the \"HCQ\" group: AIPTW absolute difference in ATE (+11.1% [3.30 to 18.9]), ratio in ATE (1.25 [1.07 to 1.42]). As for the \"HCQ+AZI\" vs neither drug, trends for significant differences and ratios in AIPTW ATE were found suggesting higher mortality rates in the former group (difference in ATE +9.83% [-0.51 to 20.17], ratio in ATE 1.40 [0.98 to 1.81];p=0.062). Conclusions Using a large non-selected population of inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in 39 hospitals in France and robust methodological approaches, we found no evidence for efficacy of HCQ or HCQ combined with AZI on 28-day mortality. Our results suggested a possible excess risk of mortality associated with HCQ combined with AZI, but not with HCQ alone. Significantly higher rates of discharge home were observed in patients treated by HCQ, a novel finding warranting further confirmation in replicative studies. Altogether, our findings further support the need to complete currently undergoing randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emilie Sbidian","author_inst":"APHP hospital"},{"author_name":"Julie Josse","author_inst":"Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lemaitre","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Imke Mayer","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Melodie Bernaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Gramfort","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Nathanael Lapidus","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Paris","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Antoine Neuraz","author_inst":"Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ivan Lerner","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Garcelon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bastien Rance","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Grisel","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moreau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Ali Bellamine","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Pierre Wolkenstein","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Gael Varoquaux","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133280","rel_title":"The effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133280","rel_abs":"Objectives: To estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a U.S. jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni S.P.

We aimed to determine whether a 6-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) improves outcome in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection at risk of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Methods. Multicentric, partially randomized, preference, open-label trial, including adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, impaired gas exchange and biochemical evidence of hyper-inflammation. Patients were assigned to standard of care (SOC), or SOC plus intravenous MP [40mg\/12h 3 days, then 20mg\/12h 3 days]. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Results. We analyzed 85 patients (34, randomized to MP; 22, assigned to MP by clinician preference; 29, control group). Patient age (mean 68{+\/-}yr) was related to outcome. The use of MP was associated with a reduced risk of the composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat, age-stratified analysis (combined risk ratio -RR- 0.55 [95% CI 0.33-0.91]; p=0.024). In the per-protocol analysis, RR was 0.11 (0.01-0.83) in patients aged 72 yr or less, 0.61 (0.32-1.17) in those over 72 yr, and 0.37 (0.19-0.74, p=0.0037) in the whole group after age-adjustment by stratification. The decrease in C-reactive protein levels was more pronounced in the MP group (p=0.0003). Hyperglycemia was more frequent in the MP group. Conclusions A short course of MP had a beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, decreasing the risk of the composite end point of admission to ICU, NIV or death.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Corral","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Alberto Bahamonde","author_inst":"Hsopital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Francisco Arnaiz delas Revillas","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Julia Gomez-Barquero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jesica Abadia-Otero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Carmen Garcia-Ibarbia","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Victor Mora","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Ana cerezo-hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jose L Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Graciela Lopez-Muniz","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hernandez-Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133629","rel_title":"Introduction to and spread of COVID-19 in care homes in Norfolk, UK","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133629","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Residential care homes for the elderly have been important settings for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We undertook a secondary analysis of a dataset about 248 care homes in the county of Norfolk, eastern England. The dataset recorded categories of staff (nurses, care workers and non-care workers), their status (available, absent due to leave or sickness and extra staff needed to address the coronavirus pandemic) in the period 6 April -6 May 2020. Counts of residents (if any) at each care home with COVID-19 were also available, as well as descriptions of access by the home to personal protection equipment (PPE: gloves, masks, eye protection, aprons and Sanitiser). PPE access was categorised as (most to least) green, amber or red. We undertook two stage modelling, first for any detection of COVID-19 in the homes, and a second model to relate any increases in case counts after introduction to staffing or PPE levels. RESULTS: We found that the counts of non-care workers had strongest relationships (and only link significant at p < 0.05) to any introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the homes. After a home had at least one detected case, higher staff levels and more severe PPE shortages were most linked to higher case counts (p < 0.05) during the monitoring period. CONCLUSION: Better managing aspects of staff interaction with residents and some working practices should help reduce ingression to and spread of COVID-19 within residential homes for the elderly.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julii Suzanne Brainard","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Steven Rushton","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Tim Winters","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Paul R Hunter","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jesica Abadia-Otero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Carmen Garcia-Ibarbia","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Victor Mora","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Ana cerezo-hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jose L Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Graciela Lopez-Muniz","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hernandez-Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133256","rel_title":"Exosomal microRNAs Drive Thrombosis in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133256","rel_abs":"Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications have been shown to play a critical role in the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Emerging evidence has shown that exosomal miRNAs are functionally involved in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes. However, neither exosomes nor miRNAs have been hitherto investigated in COVID-19. To test the hypothesis that exosomal miRNAs are a key determinant of thrombosis in COVID-19, we enrolled patients positive for COVID-19. Circulating exosomes were isolated from equal amounts of serum and levels of exosomal miRNAs were quantified. We divided our population in two groups based on the serum level of D-dimer on admission. Strikingly, we found that exosomal miR-424 was significantly upregulated whereas exosomal miR-103a, miR-145, and miR-885 were significantly downregulated in patients in the high D-dimer group compared to patients in the low D-Dimer group (p<0.0001).","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Gambardella","author_inst":"AECOM"},{"author_name":"Celestino Sardu","author_inst":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\""},{"author_name":"Marco Bruno Morelli","author_inst":"AECOM"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Messina","author_inst":"Naples Univ"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Castellanos","author_inst":"AECOM"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Marfella","author_inst":"Naples Univ"},{"author_name":"Paolo Maggi","author_inst":"Naples Univ"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Paolisso","author_inst":"Naples Univ."},{"author_name":"Xujun Wang","author_inst":"AECOM"},{"author_name":"Gaetano Santulli","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hernandez-Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francesco Tedesco","author_inst":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Immunorheumatology Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Pozzi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Meroni","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133611","rel_title":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Fear of COVID-19 during the Rapid Rise Period in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133611","rel_abs":"Objectives: To determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) related to COVID-19 preventive health habits and perception of Fear towards COVID-19 in subjects living in Bangladesh. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional survey of (n= 2157) male and female subjects, 13-90 years of age, living in Bangladesh. Methods: Ethical Approval and Trial registration were obtained prior to the commencement of the study. Subjects who volunteered to participate and signed the informed consent were enrolled in the study and completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS). Results: Twenty-eight percent (28.69%) of subjects reported one or more COVID-19 symptoms and 21.4% of subjects reported one or more comorbidities. Knowledge scores were slightly higher in males (8.75, SD 1.58) than females (8.66, SD 1.70). Knowledge was significantly correlated with age (p<.005), an education level (p<.001), Attitude (p<.001), and urban location (p<.001). Knowledge scores showed an inverse correlation with Fear scores (p<.001). Eighty-three percent (83.7%) of subjects with COVID-19 symptoms reported wearing a mask in public and 75.4% of subjects reported staying away from crowded places. Subjects with one or more symptoms reported higher Fear compared to subjects without (18.73, SD 4.6; 18.45, SD 5.1). Conclusions: Overall, Bangladeshis reported a high prevalence of self-isolation, positive preventive health behaviors related to COVID-19, and moderate to high fear levels. Higher Knowledge and Practice were found in males, higher education levels, older age, and urban location. Fear of COVID-19 was more prevalent in female and elderly subjects. Positive Attitude was reported for the majority of subjects, reflecting the belief that COVID-19 was controllable and containable.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Anwar Hossain","author_inst":"Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed"},{"author_name":"K M Amran Hossain","author_inst":"Bangladesh Health Professions Institute"},{"author_name":"Lori Maria Walton","author_inst":"University of Scranton"},{"author_name":"Zakir Uddin","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Md.
