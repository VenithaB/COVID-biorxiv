Past activity may provide a means to predict future demand. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in south London), we carried out a range of descriptive analyses to inform the Trust on patient groups who might be most likely to require inpatient and home treatment team (HTT) crisis care. We considered the 12 months following UK COVID-19 lockdown policy on 16th March, drawing on comparable findings from previous years, and quantified levels of change in service delivery to those most likely to receive crisis care. For 12-month crisis days from 16th March in 2015-19, we found that most (over 80%) were accounted for by inpatient care (rather than HTT), most (around 75%) were used by patients who were current or recent Trust patients at the commencement of follow-up, and highest numbers were used by patients with a previously recorded schizophreniform disorder diagnosis. For current\/recent patients on 16th March there had been substantial reductions in use of inpatient care in the following 31 days in 2020, more than previous years; changes in total non-inpatient contact numbers did not differ in 2020 compared to previous years, although there had been a marked switch from face-to-face to virtual contacts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Stewart","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142554","rel_title":"Citywide Nucleic Acid Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Post-lockdown Wuhan, China: Results and Implications","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142554","rel_abs":"Background: After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), stringent lockdown measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23, 2020 and April 8, 2020. To provide evidence on the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, the city government conducted a citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 14 and June 1, 2020. Methods: All city residents aged [&ge;]6 years were potentially eligible to participate the screening programme. The rate of detection of asymptomatic infected cases was calculated, and their demographic and geographic distributions were investigated. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to draw a geographic distribution of asymptomatic infected persons. Results: The screening programme recruited a total of 9,899,828 persons (response rate, 92.9%). The screening found no newly confirmed patients with COVID-19, and identified 300 asymptomatic infected cases (detection rate 0.303\/10,000). In addition, 107 of 34,424 previously recovered patients with a history of COVID-19 diagnosis were tested positive (relapse rate, 0.31%). Virus culture of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for all 300 asymptomatic cases and all 107 recovered COVID-19 patients. A total of 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases were traced and all of them had a negative nucleic acid testing result. Conclusions: Prevalence of COVID-19 nucleic acid test positivity was very low in the Wuhan general population, in recovered cases and in contacts of asymptomatic cases, five to eight weeks after the end of lockdown. These findings help resolve concerns about the post-lockdown risk of COVID-19 epidemic, and promote the recovery of economy and normal social life in Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiyi Cao","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Gan","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Max Bachmann","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Yuchai Huang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tiantian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liqing Li","author_inst":"Department of Management Science and Engineering, School of Economics and Management, Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University"},{"author_name":"Kai Lu","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Jiang","author_inst":"Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University; Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of"},{"author_name":"Yanhong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Xv","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qingfeng Tian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chuanzhu Lv","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Hainan Clinical Research Center for Acute and Critical Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fujian Song","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxv Yin","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142349","rel_title":"A handheld point-of-care system for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in under 20 minutes","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142349","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency characterized by the high rate of transmission and ongoing increase of cases globally. Rapid point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics to detect the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, are urgently needed to identify and isolate patients, contain its spread and guide clinical management. In this work, we report the development of a rapid PoC diagnostic test (< 20 min) based on reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and semiconductor technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from extracted RNA samples. The developed LAMP assay was tested on a real-time benchtop instrument (RT-qLAMP) showing a lower limit of detection of 10 RNA copies per reaction. It was validated against 183 clinical samples including 127 positive samples (screened by the CDC RT-qPCR assay). Results showed 90.55% sensitivity and 100% specificity when compared to RT-qPCR and average positive detection times of 15.45 {+\/-} 4.43 min. For validating the incorporation of the RT-LAMP assay onto our PoC platform (RT-eLAMP), a subset of samples was tested (n=40), showing average detection times of 12.89 {+\/-} 2.59 min for positive samples (n=34), demonstrating a comparable performance to a benchtop commercial instrument. Paired with a smartphone for results visualization and geo-localization, this portable diagnostic platform with secure cloud connectivity will enable real-time case identification and epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesus Rodriguez-Manzano","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kenny Malpartida-Cardenas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Moser","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ivana Pennisi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Cavuto","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Luca Miglietta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Moniri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Penn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Satta","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Frances Davies","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Frances Bolt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wendy Barclay","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alison Holmes","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pantelis Georgiou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxv Yin","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142455","rel_title":"Multiple Myeloma and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Clinical Characteristics and Prognostic Factors of Inpatient Mortality","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142455","rel_abs":"There is limited information on the characteristics, pre-admission prognostic factors, and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This retrospective case series investigated characteristics and outcomes of 167 MM patients hospitalized with COVID-19 reported from 73 hospitals within the Spanish Myeloma Collaborative Group network in Spain between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Outcomes were compared with a randomly selected contemporary cohort of 167 age-\/sex-matched non-cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted at 6 participating hospitals. Common demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome variables were collected; specific disease status and treatment data were collected for MM patients. Among the MM and non-cancer patients, median age was 71 years and 57% of patients were male in each series, and 75% and 77% of patients, respectively, had at least one comorbidity. COVID-19 clinical severity was moderate-severe in 77% and 89% of patients and critical in 8% and 4%, respectively. Supplemental oxygen was required by 47% and 55% of MM and non-cancer patients, respectively, and 21%\/9% vs 8%\/6% required non-invasive\/invasive ventilation. Inpatient mortality was 34% and 23% in MM and non-cancer patients, respectively. Among MM patients, inpatient mortality was 41% in males, 42% in patients aged >65 years, 49% in patients with active\/progressive MM at hospitalization, and 59% in patients with comorbid renal disease at hospitalization, which were independent prognostic factors of inpatient mortality on adjusted multivariate analysis. This case series demonstrates the increased risk and identifies predictors of inpatient mortality among MM patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquin Martinez-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria-Victoria Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cristina Encinas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Anna Sureda","author_inst":"Hospital Duran i Reynals, ICO, L'Hospitalet, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Hernandez-Rivas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana Lopez de la Guia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Diego Conde","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Isabel Krsnik","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elena Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosalia Riaza Grau","author_inst":"Hospital Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Gironella","author_inst":"Hopital Universitario Vall d Hebron, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Blanchard","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nerea Caminos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Donostia, Donostia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Alicia Senin","author_inst":"Institut Catala d Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Fernando Escalante","author_inst":"Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Enrique de la Puerta","author_inst":"Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Gimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Martinez-Barranco","author_inst":"Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Felipe Casado","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan Blade","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Lahuerta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Javier De La Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142414","rel_title":"The Prevalence of ocular manifestations and ocular samples polymerase chain reaction positivity in patients with COVID 19 - a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142414","rel_abs":"Objective: To estimate the prevalence of ocular manifestations and ocular samples polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity among COVID 19 patients. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using search engines (PubMed, Google Scholar, Medrixv and BioRixv) with keywords SARS CoV 2, novel coronavirus, COVID 19, ocular manifestations, conjunctival congestion, Ocular detection, Polymerase chain reaction, and conjunctivitis. The measure of heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 statistic. The pooled proportion of patients presenting with symptoms and ocular samples PCR positivity was estimated. Results: A total of 20 studies (14 studies and 6 case reports) were included in the systematic review and 14 studies were included in the metaanalysis. The pooled prevalence of conjunctivitis was 5.17% (95% CI: 2.90 to 8.04). Conjunctivitis was reported as an initial symptom of the disease in 0.858 % (95% CI: 0.31 to 1.67). Common associated features include itching, chemosis, epiphora. Seven patients (29 %) with conjunctivitis showed positive results in ocular samples, whereas 13 patients (54%) showed positive only in their nasopharyngeal samples (NPs) or sputum samples and 4 patients (16 %) were negative for both NPs and Sputum as well as ocular samples. The pooled prevalence of ocular PCR positivity was 2.90 % (95% CI: 1.77 to 4.46) vs. NPs 89.8% (95% CI: 78.80 to 79.0). Conclusion: The prevalence of conjunctivitis and ocular samples PCR positivity among COVID 19 patients was low indicating that the eye is a less affected organ. However, conjunctivitis may present as the first symptom of the disease making the patient seek medical care at the earliest.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumen Sadhu","author_inst":"The Sankara Nethralaya Academy"},{"author_name":"Sushmitha Arcot Dandapani","author_inst":"The Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Deepmala Mazumdar","author_inst":"Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Sangeetha Srinivasan","author_inst":"Medical research Foundation , Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmay Biswas","author_inst":"Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya"},{"author_name":"Ana Lopez de la Guia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Diego Conde","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Isabel Krsnik","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elena Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosalia Riaza Grau","author_inst":"Hospital Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mercedes Gironella","author_inst":"Hopital Universitario Vall d Hebron, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Blanchard","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nerea Caminos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Donostia, Donostia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Alicia Senin","author_inst":"Institut Catala d Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Fernando Escalante","author_inst":"Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Enrique de la Puerta","author_inst":"Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Gimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Martinez-Barranco","author_inst":"Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Felipe Casado","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan Blade","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Lahuerta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Javier De La Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"ophthalmology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20138628","rel_title":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 outbreak period in Beijing: An online cross-sectional survey","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20138628","rel_abs":"Abstract Purpose: This study investigated the KAP towards COVID-19 and their influencing factors among primary and middle school students during the self-quarantine period in Beijing. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among students from 18 primary and middle schools in Beijing during March 2020. Stratified cluster sampling was conducted. Demographic and KAP-related COVID-19 information was collected through an online questionnaire. The influencing factors were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 7,377 students were included. The overall correct rate for COVID-19 knowledge was 74.1%, while only 31.5% and 40.5% could identify the high-risk places of cross-infection and warning body temperature. Although 94.5% of respondents believed the epidemic could be controlled, over 50% expressed various concerns about the epidemic. The compliance rates for basic preventing behaviors were all over 80%, while those for \"rational and effective ventilation\" (39.2%) and \"dinning separately\" (38.6%) were low. The KAP levels were significantly differed according to various school categories of students. The COVID-19 knowledge (OR= 3.309, 95% CI: 2.921, 3.748) and attitude (OR=1.145, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.308) were associated with preventive practices. Besides, female, urban students, those with a healthy lifestyle, and those with the willingness to engage in healthcare tended to have better preventive practices. Conclusion: Most students in Beijing hold a high level of knowledge, optimistic attitudes and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. However, targeted interventions are still necessary, especially for students with high-risk characteristics.

Setting: Observational study with retrospective analysis in a French emergency department (ED). Participants and intervention: From March 3 to April 2, 2020, 385 adult patients presenting to the ED for suspected COVID-19 underwent an evaluation that included history, physical examination, blood tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chest CT. When the time-interval between chest CT and RT-PCR assays was longer than 7 days, patients were excluded from the study. Only patients with hospitalization criteria were included. Diagnosis accuracy was assessed using the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR, chest CT (also accompanied by lymphopenia) were measured and were also analyzed by subgroups of age and sex. Results: Among 377 included subjects, RT-PCR was positive in 36%, while chest CT was compatible with a COVID-19 diagnosis in 59%. In the population with positive RT-PCR, there were more men (55% vs 37%, p=0.015), a higher frequency of reticular and, or, interlobular septal thickening (53% vs 31%, p=0.02) as well as a higher frequency of bilateral lesion distribution (98% vs 86%, p=0.01) compared to the population with negative RT-PCR. The proportion of lymphopenia was higher in men vs women (47% vs 39%, p=0.03) and varies between patients >80 versus 50-80 and p<0.001). Using CT as reference, RT-PCR obtained a sensitivity of 61%, specificity of 93%. There was a significant difference between CT and RT-PCR diagnosis performance (p<0.001). When CT was accompanied by lymphopenia, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were respectively 71% and 94%. CT abnormalities and lymphopenia provided diagnosis in 29% of patients with negative PCR. Conclusions: Chest CT had a superior yield than RT-PCR in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, especially when accompanied by lymphopenia.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marine Thieux","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Anne Charlotte Kalenderian","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Chabrol","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Laurent Gendt","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Eurofins CBM 69"},{"author_name":"Emma Giraudier","author_inst":"Lyon 2 University Masters Degree in Medical Translation and Scientific Writing"},{"author_name":"Herve Lelievre","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Eurofins CBM 69"},{"author_name":"Samir Lounis","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Imapole"},{"author_name":"Yves Mataix","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emeline Moderni","author_inst":"Lyon 2 University Masters Degree in Medical Translation and Scientific Writing"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Paradisi","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Ranchon","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Emergency Department"},{"author_name":"Carlos El Khoury","author_inst":"Medipole Hopital Mutualiste Clinical Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Nerea Caminos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Donostia, Donostia, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez de Larrea","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Alicia Senin","author_inst":"Institut Catala d Oncologia i Institut Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Fernando Escalante","author_inst":"Hospital de Leon, Leon, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Enrique de la Puerta","author_inst":"Hospital de Galdakao, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Gimenez","author_inst":"Hospital Infanta Sofia, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pilar Martinez-Barranco","author_inst":"Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Mateos","author_inst":"Hospital de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Luis Felipe Casado","author_inst":"Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain"},{"author_name":"Joan Blade","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Lahuerta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Javier De La Cruz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre"},{"author_name":"Jesus San-Miguel","author_inst":"Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141838","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 serological testing using electrochemiluminescence reveals arapid onset of seroconversion in severe COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20141838","rel_abs":"Despite ongoing efforts to characterize the host response toward SARS-CoV-2, a major gap in our knowledge still exists regarding the magnitude and duration of the humoral response.

We provide a comprehensive analysis of the human antibody response, and has major implications on our understanding and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as finding effective vaccines.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ariel Munitz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, The Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel."},{"author_name":"Liat Edry-Botzer","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, 6997801 Israel"},{"author_name":"Michal Itan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, 6997801 Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Tur-Kaspa","author_inst":"Department of Medicine D and the Liver Institute, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Molecular Hepatology Research Laboratory, Felsenstein Medical Resear"},{"author_name":"Dror Dicker","author_inst":"Internal Medicine D, Hasharon Hospital-Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.

We describe our evaluation of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay on the Architect immunoassay analyser. Methods: We assessed the precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay in samples from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients and healthy healthcare workers. The manufacturer cut-off index (COI) of 1.4 was adopted to identify positive results. We examined the assay cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies (influenza\/dengue\/hepatitis C\/hepatitis B) and rheumatoid factor (RF). The sample throughput of the Abbott assay was also assessed. Results: The Abbott assay showed excellent precision, with a CV of 3.4% for the negative control (COI = 0.06) and 1.6% for a high positive serum sample (COI = 8.6). Residual serum was available from 57 inpatients not initially suspected of having COVID-19, 29 of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The Abbott assay has a sensitivity of 90.9-100% when tested in 54 subjects [&ge;]14 days post PCR positive, and a specificity of 100% (N = 358). There was no cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies (influenza\/dengue\/hepatitis C\/hepatitis B) and RF. The Architect Abbott assay has a throughput of 100 samples in 70 minutes. Conclusion: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay shows excellent performance that is well within FDA and CDC guidelines when testing patients [&ge;]14 days POS with little cross-reactivity from other viral antibodies. There is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 IgG develops early in the disease process.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CS Lau","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SP Hoo","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"YL Liang","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"TC Aw","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dror Dicker","author_inst":"Internal Medicine D, Hasharon Hospital-Rabin Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel.

Helmet NIV has seen an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a healthy volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation. Detailed design and manufacturing documents are provided.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Princeton Open Ventilation Monitor Collaboration","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Philippe Bourrianne","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Stanley Chidzik","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Cohen","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Peter Elmer","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hallowell","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Todd J Kilbaugh","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"David Lange","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Leifer","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Daniel R.

To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate an unprecedented 0.1 seconds of the viral proteome. Our simulations capture dramatic opening of the apo Spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, which explains and successfully predicts the existence of  cryptic epitopes. Different Spike homologues modulate the probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We also observe dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50  cryptic pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals.

RNA was extracted from 500 l of sample using a MagNA Pure Compact Instrument with an elution volume of 50l and 2. 700{micro}L of saliva were heat-inactivated at 96{degrees}C for 15 minutes, and directly subjected to RT-PCR. One step real time RT-PCR was performed using 5 l of extracted RNA or directly from 5 l of heated sample. RT-PCR was performed targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene region. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the results of the RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 81.08%, 92.86%, 96.77% and 65.00%, respectively when RNA extraction was included in the protocol with saliva, whereas sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83.78%, 92.86%, 68.42% and 96.88%, respectively, for the heat-inactivation protocol. However, when the analysis was performed exclusively on saliva samples with a limited time from the onset of symptoms (<9 days, N=28), these values were 90%, 87.5%, 44% and 98.75% for the heat-inactivation protocol.

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were recruited. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (IL-6, suPAR, KL-6, Troponin, Ferritin, LDH, BNP, Procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, NEWS score and CURB-65 were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission, or death, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) figures calculated. Results: 155 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC 0.51 ,CI:0.40-0.62), lymphocyte count (AUC 0.62 ,CI:0.51-0.72), and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.78,0.65-0.89) and suPAR (AUC 0.77 ,CI: 0.66-0.85) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS score (AUC: 0.74 ,0.64-0.83) or age (AUC: 0.70 ,0.61-0.78) performed nearly as well. Discussion: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should validate these biomarkers in a prospective fashion.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Marie Attwood","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Karen Elvers","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Anna Morley","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jorgen McKernon","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian Oates","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Charmaine Donald","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alan Noel","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alasdair MacGowan","author_inst":"BCARE, North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Carl A.

Methods: Between 28-30 April 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils, their parents and relatives, and staff of primary schools exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 in a city north of Paris, France. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms. A blood sample was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a flow-cytometry-based assay. Results: The infection attack rate (IAR) was 45\/510 (8.8%), 3\/42 (7.1%), 1\/28 (3.6%), 76\/641 (11.9%) and 14\/119 (11.8%) among primary school pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and relatives, respectively (P = 0.29). Prior to school closure on February 14, three SARS-CoV-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff of the same schools. Familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils (36\/59 = 61.0% and 4\/9 = 44.4%, respectively). In children, disease manifestations were mild, and 24\/58 (41.4%) of infected children were asymptomatic. Interpretation: In young children, SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely mild or asymptomatic and there was no evidence of onwards transmission from children in the school setting.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Grant","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Tondeur","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Yoann Madec","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Renaudat","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Fernandes Pellerin","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Gregory R.

Design : Prospective study. Setting : Treatment centres of the city of Yaounde, Cameroon, from May 7th to 24th 2020. Participants : We enrolled 51 consecutive confirmed COVID-19 on RT-PCR who having mild forms of COVID-19 and treated by hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice daily during seven days plus Azithromycin 500 mg the first day and 250 mg the remaining 4 days as per national standard. Main outcomes measures : The primary end-point was the change in QTc interval between day 0 (D0), day 3 (D3) and day 7 (D7). Secondary endpoints were changes in all other cardiac electrical conductivity patterns and the occurrence of clinical arrhythmic events during the course of treatment. Results: The population (29 men and 22 women) was aged 39 +\/- 11 years (range 17 to 61 years). Mean Tisdale score was 3.35 +\/- 0.48. No significant change from baseline (D0) of QTc was observed at D7 (429 +\/- 27 ms at D0 versus 396 +\/- 26 ms at D7; p = 0.27). A reduction of heart rate was observed between the D0 and D7 (75 +\/- 13 bpm versus 70 +\/- 13 bpm, p = 0.02) with increased QRS duration between D0 and D7 (95 +\/- 10 ms versus 102 +\/- 17 ms, p = 0.004). No symptomatic arrhythmic events occurred during the treatment course. Conclusions: No life-threatening modifications of the QT interval was observed in non-severe COVID-19 patients treated ambulatory with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

Methods Patients hospitalized between April 10th, 2020, through May 10th, 2020, who had confirmed COVID-19 infection with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, in which 65 patients have moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, and 63 patients have severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received early combination therapy of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs. They assessed for type and duration of treatment, and days need to wean from oxygen therapy, length of stay, virus clearance time, and complication or adverse events. All patients had more than 28 days follow up after discharge from the hospital. Results Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia group were 65 patients who received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50 (76.9 %) and female patients were 15 (23.1 %). 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%. All patients discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complications or significant complications. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia group were 63 patients who received methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55 (87.3 %) and female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%) patients have Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and 31 (49.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on a non-rebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %) for 5 days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. Sixty-two patients discharged home with one patient had a long stay, and the other two transferred to ICU. One long-stay patient transferred to ICU on low flow oxygen therapy.

Why healthcare workers nevertheless remain at increased risk is uncertain. Methods We conducted voluntary Covid-19 testing programmes for symptomatic and asymptomatic staff at a large UK teaching hospital using nasopharyngeal PCR testing and immunoassays for IgG antibodies. A positive result by either modality was used as a composite outcome. Risk factors for Covid-19 were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Results 1083\/9809(11.0%) staff had evidence of Covid-19 at some time and provided data on potential risk-factors. Staff with a confirmed household contact were at greatest risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.63 [95%CI 3.30-6.50]). Higher rates of Covid-19 were seen in staff working in Covid-19-facing areas (21.2% vs. 8.2% elsewhere) (aOR 2.49 [2.00-3.12]). Controlling for Covid-19-facing status, risks were heterogenous across the hospital, with higher rates in acute medicine (1.50 [1.05-2.15]) and sporadic outbreaks in areas with few or no Covid-19 patients. Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) staff were relatively protected (0.46 [0.29-0.72]). Positive results were more likely in Black (1.61 [1.20-2.16]) and Asian (1.58 [1.34-1.86]) staff, independent of role or working location, and in porters and cleaners (1.93 [1.25-2.97]). Contact tracing around asymptomatic staff did not lead to enhanced case identification. 24% of staff\/patients remained PCR-positive at [&ge;]6 weeks post-diagnosis. Conclusions Increased Covid-19 risk was seen in acute medicine, among Black and Asian staff, and porters and cleaners. A bundle of PPE-related interventions protected staff in high-risk ICU areas.","rel_num_authors":50,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David W Eyre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sheila F Lumley","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mark Campbell","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Sims","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elaine Lawson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Fiona Warren","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Tim J James","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Stuart Cox","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alison Howarth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"George Doherty","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stephanie B Hatch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James Kavanagh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Chau","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip W Fowler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Swann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Denis Volk","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dan Yang-Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole E Stoesser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Dudareva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert H Shaw","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Leon Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise O Downs","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vogt","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Ali Amini","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bernadette C Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Drennan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Donal Skelly","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Karpe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Neville","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Brent","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicola Jones","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lucas Martins Ferreira","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Christott","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Marsden","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Cornall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Derrick W Crook","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dave Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"- Oxford University Hospitals Staff Testing Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy EA Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bruno Holthof","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ebner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Conlon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20121905","rel_title":"The therapeutic effectiveness of Convalescent plasma therapy on treating COVID-19 patients residing in respiratory care units in hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20121905","rel_abs":"Objectives: The current COVID-19 pandemic needs unconventional therapies to tackle the resulted high morbidity and mortality.

Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and improvement in the clinical course of the disease were monitored clinically along with laboratory monitoring through SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM serological monitoring. Results: Patients received convalescent plasma showed reduced duration of infection in about 4 days, and showed less death rate, 1\/21 versus 8\/28 in control group. In, addition, all of the patients received convalescent plasma showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM 3 days after plasma transfusion.

This may help inform public health authority decisions regarding prevention and control strategies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz H Tess","author_inst":"Departamento de Medicina Preventiva Faculdade de Medicina da USP"},{"author_name":"Celso F H Granato","author_inst":"Divisao de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento, Grupo Fleury, Sao Paulo, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Maria C G P Alves","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude da Secretaria de Saude do Estado de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Maria C Pintao","author_inst":"Divisao de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento, Grupo Fleury, Sao Paulo, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Edgar Rizzatti","author_inst":"Divisao de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento, Grupo Fleury, Sao Paulo, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Marcia C Nunes","author_inst":"Ibope Inteligencia, Sao Paulo, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Reinach","author_inst":"USP"},{"author_name":"Stuart Cox","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alison Howarth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"George Doherty","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stephanie B Hatch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James Kavanagh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Chau","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip W Fowler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Swann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Denis Volk","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dan Yang-Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole E Stoesser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Dudareva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert H Shaw","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Leon Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise O Downs","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vogt","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Ali Amini","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bernadette C Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Drennan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Donal Skelly","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Karpe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Neville","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Brent","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicola Jones","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lucas Martins Ferreira","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Christott","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Marsden","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Cornall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Derrick W Crook","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dave Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"- Oxford University Hospitals Staff Testing Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy EA Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bruno Holthof","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ebner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Conlon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20138008","rel_title":"SUPERSPREADING AS A REGULAR FACTOR OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20138008","rel_abs":"We consider the impact of superspreading on the course of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The groups are asymptomatic superspreaders spreading the infection and sensitive persons which can only get infection. Once infected the sensitive exhibit clear symptoms and become isolated. It is shown that the ratio of increment of the number of daily cases in the beginning of the epidemic and decrement at the end of the epidemic is equal to the ratio of the spreading rates of the infection transmission from the superspreaders to potential superspreaders and to the sensitive persons, respectively. On the basis of data from 12 countries and territories it is found that the superspreaders transmit the infection to potential superspreaders approximately 4 times more often then to the sensitive persons.

However, the therapeutic effect of remdesivir is controversial. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to June 11, 2020 for randomized controlled trials on the clinical efficacy of remdesivir. The main outcomes were discharge rate, mortality, and adverse events. This study is registered at INPLASY (INPLASY202060046). RESULTS Data of 1075 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly increased the discharge rate of patients with COVID-19 compared with the placebo (50.4% vs. 45.29%; relative risk [RR] 1.19 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.34], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.754). It also significantly decreased mortality (8.18% vs. 12.70%; RR 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44-0.92], I2 = 45.7%, P = 0.175) compared to the placebo. Data of 1296 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly decreased the occurrence of serious adverse events (RR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.94], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.716).

In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Methods and findings We examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (silk, cotton, polyester), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Tests were done when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier and also when constructed as do-it-yourself face coverings. As a protective barrier and face covering, silk is more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. Silk face coverings repelled droplets as well as masks, but unlike masks they are hydrophobic and can be readily sterilized for immediate reuse. Conclusions Silk is an effective hydrophobic barrier to droplets, more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are readily re-useable via cleaning. Therefore, silk can serve as an effective material for protecting respirators under clinical conditions and as a material for face coverings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam F.

In response to the urgent public health need for accurate, effective, low-cost, and scalable COVID-19 testing technology, we evaluated and identified diagnostic solutions with potential for use as an at-home product. We conducted a deep horizon scan for antigen and serology-based diagnostics and down-selected to the most promising technologies. A total of 303 candidate products (138 antibody and 44 antigen tests) were identified. Product evaluations were based entirely on company-provided data. 73 serology-based antibody tests passing an initial scoring algorithm based on specificity and sensitivity data were then further evaluated using a second scoring algorithm. This second algorithm included a review of additional technical specifications of the devices, an analysis of supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution capacity of each vendor. 24 potential antibody products met the selection criteria for further direct laboratory evaluation. The performance metrics for selection of these 24 products are currently being evaluated in a Mass General Brigham laboratory. Testing alone might not be sufficient to prevent the spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19. Manual contact tracing could complement testing, but it is likely to fail in identifying many individuals who were in contact with a given COVID patient. The proliferation of smartphones in the population has enabled the development of solutions that can provide public health officials with valuable information for rapid and accurate contact tracing. Besides, electronic-based contact tracing solutions can be augmented by symptom self-reports gathered using electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) platforms and by physiological data collected using wearable sensors. We performed a detailed assessment of 12 ePRO solutions, 27 wearable sensors, and 44 electronic-based contact tracing solutions. These technologies were evaluated using criteria developed to assess their suitability to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified a number of solutions that could augment if not provide a more effective alternative to manual contact tracing. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework in which ePRO platforms, wearable sensors, and electronic-based contact tracing solutions would be utilized in combination with molecular and serological tests to identify and isolate COVID-19 cases rapidly.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Jorfi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.

In this paper, Beta regression is introduced as a tool to analyze the rate of hospitalization and the proportion of Intensive Care Unit admissions over both hospitalized and diagnosed patients, with the aim of explaining as well as predicting, and thus allowing to better anticipate, the impact on hospital resources during an early-phase epidemic. This is applied to the initial phase COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and its different regions from 20-Feb to 08-Apr of 2020. Spatial and temporal factors are included in the Beta distribution through a precision factor. The model reveals the importance of the lagged data of hospital occupation, as well as the rate of recovered patients. Excellent agreement is found for next-day predictions, while even for multiple-day predictions (up to 12 days), robust results are obtained in most cases in spite of the limited reliability and consistency of the data","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gil Jannes","author_inst":"Complutense University of Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jesus Barreal","author_inst":"Complutense University of Madrid"},{"author_name":"Aditi Hazra","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Fanny Herisson","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Glenn Miller","author_inst":"Mass General Brigham Incorporated, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"James A.

Time series analysis is of great importance to determine both the similarity in the behavior of COVID-19 in certain countries\/states and the establishment of models that can analyze and predict the transmission process of this infectious disease. In this contribution, an analysis of the different states of the United States will be carried out to measure the similarity of COVID-19 time series, using dynamic time warping distance (DTW) as a distance metric. A parametric methodology is proposed to jointly analyze infected and deceased persons. This metric allows to compare time series that have a different time length, making it very appropriate for studying the United States, since the virus did not spread simultaneously in all the states\/provinces. After a measure of the similarity between the time series of the states of United States was determined, a hierarchical cluster was created, which makes it possible to analyze the behavioral relationships of the pandemic between different states and to discover interesting patterns and correlations in the underlying data of COVID-19 in the United States. With the proposed methodology, nine different clusters were obtained, showing a different behavior in the eastern zone and western zone of the United States. Finally, to make a prediction of the evolution of COVID-19 in the states, Logistic, Gompertz and SIR model was computed. With these mathematical model it is possible to have a more precise knowledge of the evolution and forecast of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignacio Rojas","author_inst":"University of Granada"},{"author_name":"Fernando Rojas","author_inst":"University of Granada"},{"author_name":"Olga Valenzuela","author_inst":"University of Granada"},{"author_name":"Fanny Herisson","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Glenn Miller","author_inst":"Mass General Brigham Incorporated, Boston, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"James A.

PTX3 plasma levels are associated with poor outcome in systemic inflammatory conditions and vascular pathology. The present study was designed to assess expression and significance of PTX3 in COVID-19. By bioinformatics analysis of public databases PTX3 expression was detected in lung respiratory cell lines exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By analysis at single cell level of COVID-19 circulating mononuclear cells, we found that PTX3 was selectively expressed by monocytes among circulating leukocytes. Moreover, in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, single cell analysis revealed selective expression of PTX3 in neutrophils and macrophages, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. By immunohistochemistry, PTX3 was expressed by lung myelomocytic cells, type 2 pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells. PTX3 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 96 consecutive patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Higher PTX3 plasma levels were observed in 52 (54.2%) patients admitted in ICU (median 21.0ng\/mL, IQT 15.5-46.3 vs 12.4ng\/mL IQT 6.1-20.2 in ward patients; p=0.0017) and in 22 (23%) patients died by 28 days (39.8ng\/mL, IQT 20.2-75.7 vs 15.7ng\/mL, IQT 8.2-21.6 in survivors; p=0.0001). After determining an optimal PTX3 cut-off for the primary outcome, the Kaplan-Meier curve showed an increased mortality in patients with PTX3>22.25ng\/mL (Log-rank tests p<0.0001). In Cox regression model, PTX3>22.25ng\/mL showed an adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) of 7.6 (95%CI2.45-23.76) in predicting mortality. Performing a multivariate logistic regression including all inflammatory markers (PTX3, ferritin, D-Dimer, IL-6, and CRP), PTX3 was the only marker significantly associated with death (aHR 1.13;95%CI1.02-1.24; p=0.021). The results reported here suggest that circulating and lung myelomonocytic cells are a major source of PTX3 and that PTX3 plasma levels can serve as a strong prognostic indicator of short-term mortality in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Brunetta","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Marco Folci","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Barbara Bottazzi","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Maria De Santis","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Protti","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Sarah Mapelli","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Roberto Leone","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Ilaria My","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Monica Bacci","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Veronica Zanon","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Gianmarco Spata","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gianatti","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII"},{"author_name":"Marina Sironi","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Claudio Angelini","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Garlanda","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Michele Ciccarelli","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Cecconi","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mantovani","author_inst":"Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS; Humanitas University; The William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Dudareva","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert H Shaw","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Leon Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louise O Downs","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Vogt","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Ali Amini","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bernadette C Young","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philip Drennan","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alexander J Mentzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Donal Skelly","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Karpe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Neville","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Brent","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nicola Jones","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lucas Martins Ferreira","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Christott","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian Marsden","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Richard Cornall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Derrick W Crook","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dave Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"- Oxford University Hospitals Staff Testing Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Timothy EA Peto","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bruno Holthof","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ebner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher P Conlon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20135715","rel_title":"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20135715","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Colombia from a traveler arriving from Italy on February 26, 2020.
