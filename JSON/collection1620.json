Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2\/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. Conclusion: These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2\/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward E.

Methods: COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is essential to understand the epidemiological characteristics of the first cases in each country. The purpose of this study is to describe the geographic distribution and some risk factors in the first thousands of cases in Algeria. This descriptive study was carried out to examine recent data published by public health institutions in Algeria, websites and the world health organization. Results: The 8306 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Algeria. By sex, men with 55.76% predominate, the most affected age group was 25 to 49 years old (41.1%), 600 cases of death were reported, subjects aged over 60 years are the most likely to die from COVID-19. Most of the confirmed subjects came from the cities of Blida and Algiers. All cases are human-to-human transmissions. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of dical equipment in Algeria and in all countries of the world.

Objective. To quantify national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs in the US. Design. This is an observational study for which we obtained daily county level COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22, 2020 through the phased removal of social distancing protections. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT) analytical approach is used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Data include 3142 counties from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures. County-level NPIs were obtained from online county and state policy databases, then classified into four intervention levels: Level 1 (low), declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate), school closures, restricting nursing home access, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high), non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive). sheltering in place \/ stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. Additional county-level data were obtained to record racial (Black, Hispanic), economic (educational level, poverty), demographic (rural\/urban) and climate factors (temperature, specific humidity, solar radiation). Main Outcomes. The primary outcomes are rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case doubling times. NPI effects are measured separately for nine US Census Region (Pacific, Mountain, West North Central, East North Central, West South Central, East South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England). Results. Aggressive NPIs (level 4) significantly reduced COVID-19 case and death rates in all US Census Regions, with effect sizes ranging from 4.1% to 25.7% and 5.5% to 25.5%, respectively, for each day they were active. No other intervention level achieved significance across all US Regions. Intervention levels 3 and 4 both increased COVID-19 doubling times, with effects peaking at 25 and 40 days after initiation of each policy, respectively. The effectiveness of level 3 NPIs varied, reducing case rates in all regions except North Central states, but associated with significantly higher death rates in all regions except Pacific states. Intervention levels 1 and 2 did not indicate any effect on COVID-19 propagation and, in some regions, these interventions were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Heterogeneity of NPI effects are associated with racial composition, poverty, urban-rural environment, and climate factors. Conclusion. Aggressive NPIs are effective tools to reduce COVID-19 propagation and mortality. Reducing social and environmental disparities may improve NPI effects in regions where less strict policies are in place.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Pan","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Stefanos Tyrovolas","author_inst":"Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Iago Gine Vazquez","author_inst":"Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rishav Raj","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fernandez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM"},{"author_name":"Ben Zaitchik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul Lantos","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Christopher W.

Understanding the relationship between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for developing solutions to this global crisis. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. Method: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion\/exclusion criteria; we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional study design. Results: 27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes. Discussion: We discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability in testing, mitigation measures and pandemic stage, clustering of health outcomes, and a lack of publicly available data and code.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anushka Bhaskar","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Jay Chandra","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Danielle Braun","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Cellini","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Francesca Dominici","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Zaitchik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul Lantos","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Christopher W.

This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/257493v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab4843org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152ebeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afd7aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@793707_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efres Belmonte Reche","author_inst":"Advanced (magnetic) Theranostic Nanostructures Lab, INL-International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, Av.

We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region.

Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R{gamma}c KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teodor-Doru Brumeanu","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Pooja Vir","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Soumya Shashikumar","author_inst":"Naval Medical Research Center\/Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Infectious Diseases Directorate, Silver Spring, MD 20910, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Faisal Karim","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Swagata Kar","author_inst":"Bioqual Inc., Rockville, MD 20852, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Kevin K.

Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirill Gorshkov","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z Chen","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos de la Torre","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Z Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moran","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine, Mt.

RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes.

The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive\/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fengming Sun","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xiuhua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Shun Tan","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yanqiu Lu","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Junli Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Novogene Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxia Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Weiwei He","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xing Wan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Wenting Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"\u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Kristin R Thompkins","author_inst":"Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer Inc."},{"author_name":"Kirsten E.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96\/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng\/ml and 11.13 ng\/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides a methodology for the generation of preventive and therapeutic antibody drugs for emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XiaoJian

(SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.\n\nArticle Summary LineRaccoon dogs are susceptible to and efficiently transmit SARS-CoV2 and may serve as intermediate host","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conrad Martin Freuling","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Angele Breithaupt","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Julia Sehl","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Balkema-Buschmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Melanie Rissmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Antonia Klein","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Claudia Wylezich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dirk Hoeper","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Andrea Aebischer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Virginia Friedrichs","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anca Dorhoi","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Groschup","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Mettenleiter","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Feiyang Luo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Song","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Shunhua Long","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanan Hao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Luo Li","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guiji Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Kun Deng","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Du","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaru Nai","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Wang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Aishun Jin","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.258772","rel_title":"What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents?

Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens\/microbes).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunil Nagpal","author_inst":"BioSciences R&D, TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.

Here, we report an in-depth multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 patient autopsy samples. By integrative analysis of proteomes of seven organs, namely lung, spleen, liver, heart, kidney, thyroid and testis, we characterized 11,394 proteins, in which 5336 were perturbed in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Our data showed that CTSL, rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from COVID-19 patients. Dysregulation of protein translation, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism was detected in multiple organs. Our data suggested upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperinflammation might be triggered which in turn induces damage of gas exchange barrier in the lung, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrosis in the lung, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and thyroid. Evidence for testicular injuries included reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis and sperm mobility. In summary, this study depicts the multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies, and uncovered dysregulated proteins and biological processes, offering novel therapeutic clues.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiu Nie","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,

However, the long test run time and costs associated with this type of molecular testing are a challenge in the actual pandemic scenario. Due to high testing demand, pooling sample strategy is an interesting approach to allow cost savings. We aim to evaluate pooling tests in experimental procedures, as well as perform in silico statistical modeling analysis validated with specimen samples obtained from a mass testing program of Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Although the sensitivity reduction in samples pooled with 32 individuals was observed, the high-test sensitivity is maintained even when 16 and 8 samples were pooled. The in silico analysis showed high-cost savings in populations with positive rates lower than 15.0% according to the pool size. This data was validated with the results obtained in our mass testing program: statistical modeling predicted a cost saving of 48.0%, which in practice, was 51.5%, already considering the expenditures with pool sampling that were analyzed individually. Our data confirmed that mathematical modeling is a powerful strategy to improve the pooling approach for SARS-CoV-2 mass testing around the world while maintaining high sensitivity and robustness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isadora Alonso Correa","author_inst":"Instituto Senai de Inovacao em Quimica Verde and Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes,

post-lockdown aeromedical retrieval (AR) diagnostic reasons and patient demographics during a period of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social isolation. Methods: An observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of Australians who received an AR between the 26 January to the 23 June 2020. The main outcome measures were patient diagnostic category proportions and trends prior (28 January to 15 March), during (16 March to 4 May), and following (5 May to 23 June 2020) social isolation restrictions. Results: There were 16981 ARs consisting of 1959 (11.5) primary evacuations (PE) and 12724 (88.5) inter-hospital transfer (IHT), with a population median age of 52 years old (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0 69.0), with 49.0% (n= 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n= 6399) being female. There were a total of 6 confirmed and 209 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases (n=114; 53.0%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups. This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods (OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02 1.24 and OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08 1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in the post restriction period (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04 1.64), and increases for congenital conditions in the restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39 4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53 0.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for a retrievals of the respiratory system (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67 0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.6 1.0). Distribution between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (p<0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a significant reduction in activity. Conclusion: The lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital conditions. However, this period also resulted in a reduction of overall activity, possibly due to a reduction in other infectious disease rates, such as influenza, due to social distancing.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fergus W Gardiner","author_inst":"Royal Flying Doctor Service"},{"author_name":"Marianne Gillam","author_inst":"University of South

pandemic, broad usage of non-pharmaceutical interventions played a crucial role in controlling epidemics. However, the substantial economic and societal costs of continuous use of border controls, travel restrictions, and physical distancing measures suggest that these measures may not be sustainable and that policymakers have to seek strategies to lift the restrictions. Taiwan was one of the few countries that demonstrated initial success in eliminating the COVID-19 outbreak without strict lockdown or school closure. To understand the key contributors to the successful control, we applied a stochastic branching model to empirical case data to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of more targeted case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and less targeted population-based interventions (including social distancing and face mask use) in Taiwan. We found that case-based interventions alone would not be sufficient to contain the epidemic, even in a setting where a highly efficient contact tracing program was in place. The voluntary population-based interventions have reduced the reproduction numbers by more than 60% and have likely played a critical role at the early stage of the outbreak. Our analysis of Taiwan's success highlights that coordinated efforts from both the government and the citizens are indispensable in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ta-Chou V Ng","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Public Health,

biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures. However the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the population's disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christielly Mendonca Borges","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Marco Tulio Pacheco

pregnant women have been considered at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality. However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community. Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. Study design: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects. Results: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes. Conclusions: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erika

in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities, and inaccessible health services. This vulnerable population is especially susceptible to COVID-19, which is expected to have worsened health outcomes and exacerbate existing structural challenges in the implementation of public health measures. This study examines knowledge of COVID-19, self-reported prevalence of preexisting conditions, and access to essential health services among residents of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Somalia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design assessing demographics, current health profiles, knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, and access to resources was used. 401 Somali IDP camp residents completed the survey. Results: Though 77% of respondents reported taking at least one COVID-19 preventative public health measure, respondents reported a severe lack of access to adequate sanitation, an inability to practice social distancing, and nearly universal inability to receive a COVID-19 screening exam. Questions assessing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 prevention and treatment yielded answers of \"I don't know\" for roughly 50% of responses. The majority were not familiar with basic information about the virus or confident that they could receive medical services if infected. Those who perceived their health status to be \"fair,\" as opposed to \"good,\" showed 5.69 times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19. Respondents who felt more anxious or nervous and those who introduced one behavioral change to protect against COVID-19 transmission showed 10.16 and 5.20 times increased odds of being concerned about disease contraction, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights immense gaps in the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 and access to treatment and preventative services among individuals living in Somali IDP camps. A massive influx of additional resources is required to adequately address COVID-19 in Somalia, starting with educating those individuals most vulnerable to infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jude Alawa","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lucas A Walz","author_inst":"Yale

immunity in COVID-19 is important if we are to optimize therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T-cell memory to shared peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2. Following re-infection, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells enhance recovery and diminish clinical severity. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in vitro, with CD4+ sets being typically robust. For CD8+ T-cells taken directly ex vivo, we identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, A2\/S269-277 and A2\/Orf1ab3183-3191. Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of the A2\/S269+CD8+ and A2\/Orf1ab3183+CD8+ populations indicated that the more prominent A2\/S269+CD8+ set was detected at comparable frequency (1.3x10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. But, while the numbers were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (2.5x10-6), they were low when compared with frequencies for influenza-specific (A2\/M158) and EBV-specific (A2\/BMLF1280) (1.38x10-4) populations. Phenotypic analysis ex vivo of A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents showed that A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells were predominantly negative for the CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T-cells were granzyme and\/or perforin-positive. Furthermore, the bias towards naive, stem cell memory and central memory A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T-cell activation. Priming with an appropriate vaccine may thus have great value for optimizing protective CD8+ T-cell immunity in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer R

of information provided by websites selling home self-sampling and testing kits for COVID-19. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: All websites (n=27) selling direct to user home self-sampling and testing for COVID-19 (41 tests) in the UK (39 tests) and US (2 tests) identified by a website search on 23rd May 2020. Main outcome measures: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. Results: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32\/41; 78%), when to use the test (10\/41; 24%), test accuracy (12\/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21\/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27\/41 (66%) tests); we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values). For molecular virus tests, 9\/23 (39%) websites explained that test positives should self-isolate, and 8\/23 (35%) explained that test negatives may still have the disease. For antibody tests, 12\/18 (67%) websites explained that testing positive does not necessarily infer immunity from future infection. Seven (39%) websites selling antibody tests claimed the test had a CE mark, when they were for a different intended use (venous blood rather than finger-prick samples). Conclusions: At the point of online purchase of home self-sampling COVID-19 tests, users in the UK are provided with incomplete, and in some cases misleading information on test accuracy, intended use and test interpretation. Best practice guidance for communication about tests to the public should be developed and enforced for online sales of COVID-19 tests.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sian

To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in a non-human primate model until 28 days after virus inoculation. Cynomolgus macaques showed a fever after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening symptoms. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia.

severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.\n\nOne-sentence summarySARS-CoV-2 ORF9c is the first human coronavirus

KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) were utilized to identify functional categories and significant pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that the Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, P53 signaling pathway, and Apoptosis are the main signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids (hBOs).

of the disease course: a retrospective cohort study in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176586","rel_abs":"Diverse risk factors intercede the outcomes of COVID-19. We conducted this retrospective cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4% Vs. 6.0%) and mortality (2.3% Vs. 2.5%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17) on the 28th day. Mortality risk factors included elderly (AOR=10.14), COPD (RR=5.93), and SLT (AOR=2.25) on the 14th day, and elderly (AOR=24.37) and COPD (RR=2.72) on the 28th day. The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day. The mortality risk was higher with coronary heart disease (RR=4.54) and CLD (RR=9.66) on the 14th while with diabetes mellitus (RR=3.08, RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=3.14, RR=2.30), CKD (RR=8.97, RR=2.71), and malignant diseases (RR=10.29) on both 14th and 28th day. We must espouse program interventions considering the morbidity and mortality risk factors to condense the aggressive outcomes of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.
