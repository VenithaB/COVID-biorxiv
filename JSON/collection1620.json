Prior data on seroprevalence have been subject to variations in selection of individuals and nature as well as timing of testing in relation to exposures. Objective: We sought to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalance and the factors associated with seroprevelance across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers. Design: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionaires. Participants: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6,062) employed in a multi-site healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. Exposure: Exposure and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined by seropositivity. Main Outcomes: Using Bayesian and multi-variate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody titers, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential Covid-19 illness related exposures; and, symptoms consistent with Covid-19 infection. Results: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom in addition to fever, dry cough, anorexia, and myalgias. After adjusting for potential confounders, pre-existing medical conditions were not associated with antibody positivity. However, seroprevalence was associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, and African-American race, as well as presence of either a personal or household member having a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. Importantly, African American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal Covid-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societally factors. Notably, number of people, or children, in the home was not associated with antibody positivity. Conclusion and Relevance: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modeling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures, and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Ebinger","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory J.

Accurate clinical characterisation studies are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts, particularly early in a pandemic. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included. Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature may be underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults. Further characterisation studies in different at-risk populations is needed.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the adaptive version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the non-adaptive groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. This method is currently applied to COVID-19 screening in the Clinical Genetic Laboratory at the Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the non-adaptive groupMix method is publicly available for laboratories to implement this method.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Reza Alizad-Rahvar","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, The Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Safar Vafadar","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biological Complex Systems and Bioinformatics (CBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Totonchi","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Sadeghi","author_inst":"National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Blake Thomson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark G Pritchard","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter G Bannister","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Louise Sigfrid","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom Solomon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Peter W Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gail Carson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piero L Olliaro","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mir Henglin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shehnaz K.

This central role for T cells makes them a desirable target for assessing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we combined two high-throughput immune profiling methods to create a quantitative picture of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2. First, at the individual level, we deeply characterized 3 acutely infected and 58 recovered COVID-19 subjects by experimentally mapping their CD8 T-cell response through antigen stimulation to 545 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I presented viral peptides (class II data in a forthcoming study). Then, at the population level, we performed T-cell repertoire sequencing on 1,815 samples (from 1,521 COVID-19 subjects) as well as 3,500 controls to identify shared \"public\" T-cell receptors (TCRs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from both CD8 and CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that CD8 T-cell responses are often driven by a few immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes. As expected, the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peaks about one to two weeks after infection and is detectable for at least several months after recovery. As an application of these data, we trained a classifier to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection based solely on TCR sequencing from blood samples, and observed, at 99.8% specificity, high early sensitivity soon after diagnosis (Day 3-7 = 85.1% [95% CI = 79.9-89.7]; Day 8-14 = 94.8% [90.7-98.4]) as well as lasting sensitivity after recovery (Day 29+\/convalescent = 95.4% [92.1-98.3]). These results demonstrate an approach to reliably assess the adaptive immune response both soon after viral antigenic exposure (before antibodies are typically detectable) as well as at later time points. This blood-based molecular approach to characterizing the cellular immune response has applications in clinical diagnostics as well as in vaccine development and monitoring.","rel_num_authors":56,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas M Snyder","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Gittelman","author_inst":"Adaptive

spread of COVID-19 in community is use of face mask. Though the debate is going on regarding the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it makes reasonable point for universal use of face masks. A large variety of face masks are available in the market or people can make their own using household items. The efficacy of masks depends upon the type of cloth and number of layers of the cloth. Material and methods: We have created an innovative mask with two layers of cotton and an impervious layer. The impervious layer made from polypropylene coated with polyurethane was applied on the outer side in the middle half of the mask in front of mouth and nose. The efficacy of this test mask was measured against N95FFR (reference standard), triple layer surgical masks and single layer cotton mask. A manikin was used wearing these masks\/respirator and aerosols\/droplets of diluted red colored carbol fuchsin and fluorescent Auramine O were sprayed from distance of 1m and 2m. We also tested use of face shield. Both macroscopic and microscopic examination of the dissected masks and respirator was performed. Results: The N95FFR was able to block the aerosols\/droplets by its front layer. One triple layer surgical mask showed microscopic presence of stain in its innermost layer while the other blocked it with middle layer. The single layer cotton mask was not able to protect as we observed stain on the face itself. The test mask blocked most of the stain on impervious layer and also on the front cotton layer on lateral sides, where impervious layer was absent. When fluorescent stain was used, ultraviolet examination demonstrated that the whole area covered by test mask was clean while the other non covered area was fluorescent. Conclusion: We believe that our innovation can be used in the community as well as in general areas of the hospital like, offices, labs, etc. and can be a better alternative to single use triple layer surgical masks. Further testing may be done by other organizations to rule out bias in our study.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priyanka L Shahane-Kapse","author_inst":"Mahatma Gandhi Institute

occurred in late February 2020, with subsequent outbreaks occurring in the populous Portland metro area but also with significant outbreaks in less-populous and rural areas. Here we report viral sequences from 188 patients across the hospitals and associated clinics in the Providence Health System in the State of Oregon dating back to the early days of the outbreak. We show a significant shift in dominant clade lineages over time in Oregon, with the rapid emergence and dominance of Spike D614G-positive variants. We also highlight significant diversity in SARS-CoV-2 sequences in Oregon, including a large number of rare mutations, indicative that these genomes could be utilized for outbreak tracing. Lastly, we show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic information may offer additional utility in combination with clinical covariates in the prediction of acute disease phenotypes.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexa K.

The quality and acceptability of self-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is unknown. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the acceptability of self-collected NPS among HCW. Design: Cross-sectional convenience sample enrolled between April 20th and June 24th, 2020. We had >95% power to detect at least one positive test if the true underlying prevalence of SARS-CoV2 was > 1%. Setting: The metropolitan area surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants: HCW free of self-reported upper respiratory symptoms were recruited. Exposures: Participants completed questionnaires regarding demographics, household characteristics, personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization and comorbidities. Outcomes: A participant self-collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed via polymerase chain reaction. NPS discomfort was assessed on a scale of 1 (no discomfort) - 10 (extreme discomfort). NPS duration and depth into the nasopharynx, and willingness to perform future self-collections were assessed. Results: Among n=489 participants 80% were female and mean age+\/-SD was 41+\/-11. Participants reported being physicians (14%), nurse practitioners (8%), physicians assistants (4%), nurses (51%), medics (3%), or other which predominantly included laboratory technicians and administrative roles (22%). Exposure to a known\/suspected COVID-19 case in the 14 days prior to enrollment was reported in 40% of participants. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any participant. The mean+\/-SD discomfort level of the NPS was 4.5+\/-2.0. 95% of participants reported that their self-swab was longer than or equal to the duration of patient swabs they had previously performed, and 89% reported the depth to be deeper than or equal to the depth of previous patient swabs. Over 95% of participants reported a willingness to repeat a self-collected NP swab in the future. Conclusions and Relevance: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely very low in symptom-free Minnesota healthcare workers from April 20th and June 24th, 2020. Self-collected NP swabs are well-tolerated and a viable alternative to provider-collected swabs to preserve PPE.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan T.

(SARS-CoV-2) infections has affected more than 15 million people and, as of 22 July 2019, caused deaths of more than 0.6 million individuals globally. With the excretion of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, its genome detection in the sewage water can be used as a powerful epidemiological tool to predict the number of positive cases in a population. This study was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 genome in sewage water during the lockdown. Sewage samples, from 28 pre-selected sites, were collected on alternate days from 13-25 July, 2020 from two selected areas [Johar Town (n = 05) and Township (n = 23)], where smart lockdown were implemented by the government authorities on 9th July, 2020. Genomic RNA was extracted and the SARS-CoV-2 was detected and quantified using commercially available kit through Real-Time PCR. Out of 28, sixteen samples were positive on day one while 19, 17, 23, 17, 05 and 09 samples were positive on day 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, respectively. These results indicate the decreasing viral copy load with the passage of time however few sites did not followed a clear pattern indicating the complexities in sewage water based surveillance i.e time of sampling. Hourly sampling from two sites for 24 hours also revealed the impact of time sampling time on detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in sewage pipelines and lift\/disposal stations. Results of current study indicate a possible role of sewage-based COVID-19 surveillance in monitoring and execution of smart lockdowns.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tahir

around 500,000 deaths. In Mexico, by April 29, the general case fatality was 6.52%, with 11.1% confirmed case mortality and hospital recovery rate around 72%. Once hospitalized, the odds for recovery and hospital death rates depend mainly on the patients' comorbidities and age. In Mexico, triage guidelines use algorithms and risk estimation tools for severity assessment and decision-making. The study's objective is to analyze the underlying conditions of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Mexico concerning four severity outcomes. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort based on registries of all laboratory-confirmed patients with the COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization in Mexico. Independent variables were comorbidities and clinical manifestations. Dependent variables were four possible severity outcomes: (a) pneumonia, (b) mechanical ventilation (c) intensive care unit, and (d) death; all of them were coded as binary Results: We included 69,334 hospitalizations of laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized patients to June 30, 2020. Patients were 55.29 years, and 62.61% were male. Hospital mortality among patients aged<15 was 9.11%, 51.99% of those aged >65 died. Male gender and increasing age predicted every severity outcome. Diabetes and hypertension predicted every severity outcome significantly. Obesity did not predict mortality, but CKD, respiratory diseases, cardiopathies were significant predictors. Conclusion: Obesity increased the risk for pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care admittance, but it was not a predictor of in-hospital death. Patients with respiratory diseases were less prone to develop pneumonia, to receive mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit assistance, but they were at higher risk of in-hospital death.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genny Carrillo","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Nina Mendez Dominguez","author_inst":"Universidad Marista, School of

to COVID 19 confirmed cases is a well known strategy for limiting the transmission of infection. However, there is a need for evidence-based guidelines for the quarantine of HCWs in COVID 19. Methods: We describe our experience of contact tracing and risk stratification of 3853 HCWs who were exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases in a tertiary health care institution in India. We developed an algorithm, on the basis of risk stratification, to rationalize quarantine among HCWs. Risk stratification was based on the duration of exposure, distance from the patient, and appropriateness of personal protection equipment (PPE) usage. Only high-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days. They underwent testing for COVID 19 after five days of exposure, while low risk contacts continued their work with adherence to physical distancing, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of PPE. The low-risk contacts were encouraged to monitor for symptoms and report for COVID 19 screening if fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred. We followed up all contacts for 14 days from the last exposure and observed for symptoms of COVID 19 and test positivity. Results and interpretation: Out of total 3853 contacts, 560 (14.5%) were categorized as high-risk contacts, and 40 of them were detected positive for COVID 19, with a test positivity rate of 7.1% (95% CI = 5.2, 9.6). Overall, 118 (3.1%) of all contacts tested positive. Our strategy prevented 3215 HCWs from being quarantined and saved 45,010 person-days of health workforce until June 8, 2020, in the institution. We conclude that exposure-based risk stratification and quarantine of HCWs is a viable strategy to prevent unnecessary quarantine, in a healthcare institution.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ravneet Kaur","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shashi Kant","author_inst":"All

Many factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, and the success of public health interventions depends on the level of community adherence to preventative measures. Public health professionals must also understand regional demographic variation in health disparities and determinants to target interventions more effectively. In this study, a systematic evaluation of three significant interventions employed in the US, and their effectiveness in slowing the early spread of COVID-19 was conducted. Next, community-level compliance with a state-level stay at home orders was assessed to determine COVID-19 spread behavior. Finally, health disparities that may have contributed to the disproportionate acceleration of early COVID-19 spread between certain counties were characterized. The contribution of these factors for the disproportionate spread of the disease was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results of this investigation show that delayed implementation of public health interventions, a low level of compliance with the stay at home orders, in conjunction with health disparities, significantly contributed to the early spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliea M.

It is still unclear how ongoing land use changes may facilitate SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans. Here we use a multivariate hotspot analysis of high-resolution land-use data to show that regions of China populated by horseshoe bats are hotspots of forest fragmentation, livestock and human density. We also identify areas susceptible to new hotspot emergence in response to moderate expansion of urbanization, livestock production, or forest disturbance, thereby highlighting regions vulnerable to SARS-CoV spillover under future land-use change. In China population growth and increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic development have expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forests. The reduced distance between horseshoe-bats and humans elevates the risk for SARS-related coronavirus transmission to humans.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rulli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Paolo D'Odorico","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nikolas Galli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"David Hayman","author_inst":"Massey University"},{"author_name":"Brent M.

India","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20166249","rel_abs":"Underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths is a hindrance to correctly modeling and monitoring the pandemic. This is primarily due to limited testing, lack of reporting infrastructure and a large number of asymptomatic infections. In addition, diagnostic tests (RT-PCR tests for detecting current infection) and serological antibody tests for IgG (to assess past infections) are imperfect. In particular, the diagnostic tests have a high false negative rate. Epidemiologic models with a latent compartment for unascertained infections like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models can provide predictions for unreported cases and deaths under certain assumptions. Typically, the number of unascertained cases is unobserved and thus we cannot validate these estimates for a real study except for simulation studies. Population-based seroprevalence studies can provide a rough estimate of the total number of infections and help us check epidemiologic model projections. In this paper, we develop a method to account for high false negative rates in RT-PCR in an extension to the classic SEIR model. We apply this method to Delhi, the national capital region of India, with a population of 19.8 million and a COVID-19 hotspot of the country, obtaining estimates of underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 times and that for deaths at 8-13 times. Based on a recently released serological survey for Delhi with an estimated 22.86% seroprevalence, we compute adjusted estimates of the true number of infections reported by the survey (after accounting for misclassification of the antibody test results) which is largely consistent with the model outputs, yielding an underreporting factor for cases from 30-42. Together with the model and the serosurvey, this implies approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported and whereas only 109,140 cases were reported on July 10, the true number of infections varied somewhere between 4.4-4.6 million across different estimates. While repeated serological monitoring is resource intensive, model-based adjustments, run with the most up to date data, can provide a viable option to keep track of the unreported cases and deaths and gauge the true extent of transmission of this insidious virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rupam Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann

human endemic coronaviruses has been linked to disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assays that are capable of concomitantly detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate this question. We set up a platform for serum-screening and developed a bead-based Western blot system, namely DigiWest, capable of running hundreds of assays using microgram amounts of protein prepared directly from different viruses. METHODS: The parallelized and miniaturised DigiWest assay was adapted for detecting antibodies using whole protein extract prepared from isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. After characterisation and optimization of the newly established test, whole virus lysates of OC43, 229E, and NL63 were integrated into the system. RESULTS: The DigiWest-based immunoassay system for detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies shows a sensitivity of 87.2 % and diagnostic specificity of 100 %. Concordance analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays available by Roche, Siemens, and Euroimmun indicates a comparable assay performance (Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.8799-0.9429). In the multiplexed assay, antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63 were detected, displaying a high incidence of seroreactivity against these coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: The DigiWest-based immunoassay, which uses authentic antigens from isolated virus particles, is capable of detecting individual serum responses against SARS-CoV-2 with high specificity and sensitivity in one multiplexed assay. It shows high concordance with other commercially available serologic assays. The DigiWest approach enables a concomitant detection of antibodies against different endemic coronaviruses and will help to elucidate the role of these possibly cross-reactive antibodies.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Fink","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Felix

Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.20165837","rel_abs":"There are a number of recent studies detailing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) via both Droplet and Aerosol airborne particle routes of infection. Because of this, it is necessary to understand the release of different sized particles in activities such as playing brass instruments in order for an analysis of risk to take place for such activities. In this investigation, the quantity and size of particles released by brass instruments while they are played was analysed for 7 different types of brass instrument. This was contrasted with the same individuals breathing as a comparison for more general activities as well as the effect of a mitigating polycotton barrier over the end of their instruments. To investigate the particles released, the particles were size sorted and counted with a six-channel laser particle counter. Multiple measurements were made by each individual in each condition investigated. The mean concentration exiting across all instruments measured was found to be 1.21x107{+\/-}1.03x106 Aerosol type particles\/m3 and 1.43x104{+\/-}9.01x102 Droplet type particles\/m3 per minute. When breathing, the mean count was 1.61x107{+\/-}1.33x106 Aerosol type particle\/m3 and 5.45x103{+\/-}1.20x103 Droplet type particles\/m3. When playing with a barrier cover, the mean number of particles emitted fell to 2.60x106{+\/-}2.11x105 Aerosol type particle\/m3 and 5.20x103{+\/-}8.02x102 Droplet type particles\/m3. This barrier represented an average 78.5% reduction for the number of respiratory Aerosol type particles and 63.8% reduction for Droplet type particles compared to playing an instrument without the barrier covering. It was investigated what effect playing for a more extended period of time had on the release of particles with comparisons made to singing, breathing and covering the instruments' bell ends with a barrier cap. This showed that the mean number of Aerosol type particles produced while playing was 5.38x107{+\/-}3.15x106 Aerosol type particles\/m3 produced and showed a significant drop in Aerosol type particle production when playing with a barrier used, with a mean average of 2.28x106{+\/-}8.01x104 Aerosol type particles\/m3. Both breathing and singing showed consistent numbers of Aerosol type particles produced with means of 6.59x107{+\/-}7.94x105 Aerosol type particles\/m3 and 5.28x107{+\/-}5.36x105 Aerosol type particles\/m3 respectively. This showed a drop in mean Aerosol type particles\/m3 of 95.7% when using a barrier cap compared to playing without a barrier. It is concluded that, while playing a brass instrument, the propagation of respiratory Aerosols does occur and, to a smaller extent, so do Droplet size particles, but at a lower level than when the subject was breathing without an instrument. Finally, it was shown that the use of a barrier cap on the bell end of the instrument offers a significant reduction in the production of respiratory Aerosols into the immediate surroundings, which offers a possible mitigation method for playing in groups from the release of Aerosol type particles, especially in hard to ventilate spaces.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Stuart Parker","author_inst":"Brass Bands England"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Crookston","author_inst":"Brass Bands

extensively studied in blood, relatively little is known about the mucosal immune response and its relationship to systemic antibody levels. Since SARS-CoV-2 initially replicates in the upper airway, the antibody response in the oral cavity is likely an important parameter that influences the course of infection. We developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to detect IgA and IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) in serum (n=496) and saliva (n=90) of acute and convalescent patients with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 ranging from 3-115 days post-symptom onset (PSO), compared to negative controls. Anti-CoV-2 antibody responses were readily detected in serum and saliva, with peak IgG levels attained by 16-30 days PSO. Whereas anti-CoV-2 IgA antibodies rapidly decayed, IgG antibodies remained relatively stable up to 115 days PSO in both biofluids. Importantly, IgG responses in saliva and serum were correlated, suggesting that antibodies in the saliva may serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baweleta Isho","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Kento T Abe","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;

Methods We investigated GT online searches for the search terms toothache and tooth pain, within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of national\/regional lockdowns in each country. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We analysed data after normalising based on the Internet penetration rate. We used one-way ANOVA to identify statistical difference for RSVs between 2020 and 2016-2019 for each country. A linear regression model was used to assess whether there is a correlation between RSVs in 2020 and gross domestic production, COVID-19 deaths, dentists' density, YLDs of oral conditions, Internet access, lockdown duration, Education Index, and dental expenditure per capita. Results The results of worldwide RSVs for toothache and tooth pain also showed significantly higher values in 2020 compared to the previous four years. Of 23 included countries in our study, 16 showed significantly increased RSVs during the lockdown period compared to the same periods in the past four years. There was a statistically significant relationship between difference of RSVs means in 2020 and in 2016-2019 combined with percent of urban residency (B=-1.82; 95% CI: (-3.38, -0.26); p=0.026) and dental expenditure per capita (B=-0.42; 95% CI: (-0.80, -0.05); p=0.031) (R2=0.66). Conclusion Generally, the interest in toothache and tooth pain has significantly increased in 2020 compared to the last four years. This could implicitly reinforce the importance of dental care, as urgent medical care worldwide. Governments' expenditure on oral healthcare and the rate of urban residency, could be mentioned as important factors to direct general populations' online care-seeking behaviour with regard to dental pain.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Peyman Ghasemi","author_inst":"Department of Health Economics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mona Nasser","author_inst":"Peninsula Dental School, Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, Plymouth, UK."},{"author_name":"Bita Mesgarpour","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Jenny H Wang","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zhijie Li","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Gary Chao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

In Myanmar, first COVID-19 reported cases were identified on 23rd March 2020. There were 336 reported confirmed cases, 261 recovered and 6 deaths through 13th July 2020. The study was a retrospective case series and all COVID-19 confirmed cases from 23rd March to 13th July 2020 were included. The data series of COVID-19 cases were extracted from the daily official reports of the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), Myanmar and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Myanmar. Among 336 confirmed cases, there were 169 cases with reported transmission events. The median serial interval was 4 days (IQR 3, 2-5) with the range of 0 - 26 days. The mean of the reproduction number was 1.44 with (95% CI = 1.30-1.60) by exponential growth method and 1.32 with (95% CI = 0.98-1.73) confident interval by maximum likelihood method. This study outlined the epidemiological characteristics and epidemic parameters of COVID-19 in Myanmar. The estimation parameters in this study can be comparable with other studies and variability of these parameters can be considered when implementing disease control strategy in Myanmar.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aung Min Thway","author_inst":"Defence Services Medical Academy, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Htun Tayza","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Tun Tun Win","author_inst":"Defence Services Medical Academy, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Ye Minn Tun","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit,  Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Moe Myint Aung","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Yan Naung Win","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Kyaw M Tun","author_inst":"Defence Services Medical Academy"},{"author_name":"Gary Chao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im\/ern.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Colom","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Morel","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Ye Minn Tun","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit,  Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Moe Myint Aung","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Yan Naung Win","author_inst":"Health and Disease Control Unit, Myanmar"},{"author_name":"Kyaw M Tun","author_inst":"Defence Services Medical Academy"},{"author_name":"Gary Chao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

Of these studies, 72% of them reported a median or mean incubation period of 4-7 days, while our estimated median was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6-5.2). However, the inclusion of 81 asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients, as well as 31 cases with incubation periods exceeding 14 days, led to our estimation of 97.5th percentile with 19.2 days (95% CI: 17.4-21.4), beyond the currently suggested 14-day quarantine period.

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29\/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depends on R0, the duration of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ethan Obie Romero-Severson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Steven Sanche","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Jing","author_inst":"Shanxi medical university"},{"author_name":"Binzhi Ren","author_inst":"Shanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Diseas"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

Towards addressing this need, we applied a stochastic transmission model to quantify the impact of university-level responses to past outbreaks on their campuses and used it to determine which control interventions are most effective. The model aims to simultaneously overcome three crucial issues: stochastic variation in small populations, missing or unobserved case data, and changes in disease transmission rates post-intervention. We tested the model and assessed various interventions using data from the 2014 and 2016 mumps outbreaks at Ohio State University and Harvard University, respectively. Our results suggest that universities should design more aggressive diagnostic procedures and stricter isolation policies to decrease infectious disease incidence on campus. Our model can be applied to data from other outbreaks in college campuses and similar small-population settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirai Shah","author_inst":"Harvard College"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Ferra","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Susan Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Harvard University Health Services"},{"author_name":"Paul Barreira","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pardis Sabeti","author_inst":"Harvard University;

Mounting scientific evidence from observational studies suggests that face masks for the general public may reduce the spread of infections. However, results from randomized control trials (RCT) have been presented as inconclusive, and concerns related to the safety and efficacy of non-surgical face masks in non-clinical settings remain. This controversy calls for a meta-analysis which considers non-compliance in RCTs, the time-lag in benefits of universal masking, and possible adverse effects. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs of non-surgical face masks in preventing viral respiratory infections in non-hospital and non-household settings at cumulative and maximum follow-up as primary endpoints. The search for RCTs yielded five studies published before May 29th, 2020. We pooled estimates from the studies and performed random-effects meta-analysis and mixed-effects meta-regression across studies, accounting for covariates in compliance vs. non-compliance in treatment. Results: Face masks decreased infections across all studies at maximum follow-up (p=0.0318$, RR=0.608 [0.387 - 0.956]), and particularly in studies without non-compliance bias. We found significant between-study heterogeneity in studies with bias (I^2=71.2%, p=0.0077). We also used adjusted meta-regression to account for heterogeneity. The results support a significant protective effect of masking (p=0.0006, beta=0.0214, SE= 0.0062). No severe adverse effects were detected. Interpretation: The meta-analysis of existing randomized control studies found support for the efficacy of face masks among the general public. Our results show that face masks protect populations from infections and do not pose a significant risk to users. Recommendations and clear communication concerning the benefits of face masks should be provided to limit the number of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanna M Ollila","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Markku Partinen","author_inst":"Helsinki Sleep Clinic, Vitalmed Research Center and Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Jukka Koskela","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Riikka Savolainen","author_inst":"Newcastle University Business School,  \t    Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Anna Rotkirch","author_inst":"Population Research Institute, Vaestoliitto - The Family Federation of Finland"},{"author_name":"Liisa T Laine","author_inst":"Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, The Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Diseas"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Huang","author_inst":"University of Arkansas"},{"author_name":"Zhenlong Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Yuqin Jiang","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Ye","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Chengbin Deng","author_inst":"State University of New York at Binghamton"},{"author_name":"Jiajia Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

Preliminary evidence suggests that preterm births dropped dramatically following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We undertook a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on 9, 15, and 23 March 2020 on the incidence of preterm birth. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-2020) and cross-validated these against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were conducted according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socio-economic status. Results Data on 1,599,549 singleton newborns were available, including 56,720 post-implementation births. Consistent reductions in preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding implementation of the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures: +\/- 2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.91), p=0.002; +\/- 3 months (n=796,531): 0.85 (0.73-0.98), p=0.028; +\/- 4 months (n=1,066,872): 0.84 (0.73-0.97), p=0.023. Decreases observed following the 15 March measures were of smaller magnitude and not statistically significant. No changes were observed after 23 March. Preterm birth reductions after 9 March were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to high-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods, but effect modification was not statistically significant. Conclusion In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a 15-23% drop in preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations in other countries. It is now of pivotal importance that integration of comparable data from across the globe is undertaken to further substantiate these findings and start exploring the underlying mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasper V Been","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Lizbeth Burgos Ochoa","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Loes CM Bertens","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Eric AP Steegers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Irwin KM Reiss","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

A plethora of facial coverings and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns: N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters, lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the performance of much costlier masks. This discovery supports the idea of low-cost enhancements to reduce transmission and protect individuals from contracting COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hari Bhimaraju","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Nitish Nag","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Jain","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Sam Schoenmakers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Eric AP Steegers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Irwin KM Reiss","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Li","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Tong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Health Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Olga L Rojas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Yeo Myong Bang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Annie Pu","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Natasha Christie-Holmes","author_inst":"Combined Containment Level 3 Unit, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Christian Gervais","author_inst":"Mammalian Cell Expression, Human Health Therapeutics Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Derek Ceccarelli","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Furkan Guvenc","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Patrick Budylowski","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto;

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19. Methods: Sixteen COVID-19 patients received transfusion of anti-COVID-19 antibody-positive convalescent plasma. The main outcome was time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative. Clinical laboratory parameters were measured at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion as well. Results: Among the 16 patients, 10 of them had a consistently positive result of viral NAA test before convalescent plasma transfusion. Eight patients (8\/10) became negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative after transfusion (mean rank 2.17 vs 5.90, P = 0.036). Two critically ill patients transfused plasma with lower antibody level remained a positive result of NAA test. CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day after convalescent plasma treatment, compared with the baseline (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. Conclusions: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after transfusion, and the negative time of severe patients was shorter than that of critically ill patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shanshan Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Chunya Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Huaqi Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qiankun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liyinghui Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Li","author_inst":"Henan Red Cross Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Ma","author_inst":"Henan Red Cross Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Qian Sang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Luyang Xu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjin Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fangfang Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yi Kang","author_inst":"Henan Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lihua Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliatied Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Aimee Paterson","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yue Feng Yun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Lina M Marin","author_inst":"College of Dentistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Caldwell","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Ontario;
