In this study, the clinical characteristics, laboratory testing and epidemiology survey results of 10 LTx recipients undergoing allograft lung transplantation surgeries in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected. A web-based epidemiology questionnaire was used to collect the information of LTx recipients after discharge. Up to now, none of the LTx recipients or their family members get infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the novel coronavirus pandemic. In conclusion, under the premise of taking appropriate preventive measures during hospitalization and after discharge, the lung transplant program can be maintained in the medical institution that accepts patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lingxiao Qiu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Cong Wang","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Caihong Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Huaqi Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguang Zhao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zeming Fang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Chang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Gaofeng Zhao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Guojun Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"transplantation"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147629","rel_title":"Are men dying more than women by COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147629","rel_abs":"We aimed to clarify if the infection and death rate by COVID-19 differ among gender in the top 50 countries with the highest death rates.

Meta-analyses and meta-regressions approaches were applied to official public data reported by the Word Health Organization and governments until May, 2020. A random effect model was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was calculated by I2 statistic. There was not significative difference between men and women to be infected by COVID-19 (P = 0.42), though a significative difference was observed for death rate (P < 0.0001). High heterogeneity was observed among countries. For both infection and death rates this variability was mainly explained by the HDI (42.3% and 54.2%), average age (40.9% and 40.3%) and temperature (30.1% and 39.3%). Man are dying more than women around the word by COVID-19. Countries with highest HDI present less difference between sexes.

The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition.

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Gandhar Mahadeshwar","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry"},{"author_name":"Anna Marie Pyle","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology & Department of Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute"},{"author_name":"Na Young Kim","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Euni Sim","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Jun Young Choi","author_inst":"ABION Inc., R&D Center"},{"author_name":"Dong Hyun Song","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"},{"author_name":"Gyeung Haeng Hur","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"},{"author_name":"Young Kee Shin","author_inst":"College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Seong Tae Jeong","author_inst":"Agency for Defense Development"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.191775","rel_title":"Favipiravir and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hamster model","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.191775","rel_abs":"Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2.

When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity.

Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication\/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication\/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPrinciple of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis detection by a fluorescence-based high throughput screening assay\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/192005v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8122dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d95362org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f15222_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- A new SARS-CoV non radioactive RNA polymerase assay is described\n- The robotized assay is suitable to identify RdRp inhibitors based on HTS","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Eydoux","author_inst":"AMU"},{"author_name":"Veronique Fattorini","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Shannon","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Thi-Tuyet-Nhung Le","author_inst":"CNRS-AMU"},{"author_name":"Bruno Didier","author_inst":"Univ.

This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heather L Wells","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael C Letko","author_inst":"NIH\/NIAID"},{"author_name":"Gorka Lasso","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benard Ssebide","author_inst":"Gorilla Doctors, Wildlife Health Institute, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Julius Nziza","author_inst":"Gorilla Doctors, Wildlife Health Institute, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Denis K Byarugaba","author_inst":"Makerere University College of Veterinary Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isamara Navarrete-Macias","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Liang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael Cranfield","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Barbara A Han","author_inst":"Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies"},{"author_name":"Morgan W Tingley","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Maria Diuk-Wasser","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Tracey Goldstein","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Christine Kreuder Johnson","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Jonna Mazet","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Kartik Chandran","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Gilardi","author_inst":"One Health Institute, Wildlife Health Center, University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Simon J Anthony","author_inst":"Columbia University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.184374","rel_title":"Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.184374","rel_abs":"Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019.

This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking.

To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Langellotto","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin T.

The high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to environmental, immunological, and molecular factors. The Spike protein is the foremost molecular factor responsible for virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid viral spread. The dense glycosylation of Spike, its high affinity of binding to the human ACE2 receptor, and the efficient priming by cleavage have already been proposed for driving efficient virus-host entry, but these do not explain its unusually high transmission rate. I have investigated the Spike from six {beta}-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the defined fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The architecture of the Spike quaternary structure ensures the participation of the fusion peptides in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines shows significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo, inferred from comparative studies of their deletion-mutant in a fellow murine {beta}-coronavirus MHV-A59. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\nSignificance StatementThe three proximal fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop in Spike protein are the membranotropic segments most suitable for engaging the host membrane surface for its disruption. Spikes unique quaternary structure architecture drives the fusion peptides to initiate the protein host membrane contact. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic among other human coronavirus Spikes, including the fusion peptides that are structurally more rigid owing to the presence of consecutive prolines, aromatic\/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive {beta}-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The synergy accrued from the location of the fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the virus fusion process and may explain the high spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debnath Pal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Benjamin T.

However, a broad societal discourse and a participatory decision-making process on the criteria underpinning the decision was often not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. Objective: To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on national and sub-national level implementation of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We employed the best-fit framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In a first phase adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies (e.g. school reopening). In a second phase we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous framework versions into the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, supported by 48 aspects, the metacriterion quality of evidence and embraces a complexity and systems-perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion: In a third phase, the proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan M Stratil","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology IBE, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 17, 81377 Munich    and   Pettenkofer School of Public"},{"author_name":"Maike Voss","author_inst":"German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), Global Issues Division, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Laura Arnold","author_inst":"Academy of Public Health Services, Kanzlerstrasse 4, 40472 Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Merc\u00e8 Llabr\u00e9s","author_inst":"University of the Balearic Islands"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Valiente","author_inst":"Technical University of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Laura Arnold","author_inst":"Academy of Public Health Services, Kanzlerstrasse 4, 40472 Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1\/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon\/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors\/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma L Robinson","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kanar Alkass","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olaf Bergmann","author_inst":"TU-Dresden"},{"author_name":"Janet J Maguire","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Llewelyn Roderick","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anthony P Davenport","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael Super","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward J.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 2010-2020. Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation. We compared samples across age, ranging from 40-83 years old in the ventilated cohort and 14-80 years old in the non-ventilated cohort. Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II \/ AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells. In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). Additionally, we observed prominent pulmonary endothelial ACE2 expression in 2 patients on either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven A Baker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Shirley Kowk","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Gerald J Berry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thomas J Montine","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Llewelyn Roderick","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anthony P Davenport","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael Super","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward J.

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir\/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800\/200 mg on day 1, and 400\/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug\/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung. CRP values significantly correlated with LPV but not HCQ plasma concentrations, implying inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism by inflammation.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catia Marzolini","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Felix Stader","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Marcel Stoeckle","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Fabian Franzeck","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Alexa Hollinger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Michael Osthoff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Maja Weisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Eva Caroline Gebhard","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Veronika Baettig","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Geenen","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin-Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Hirsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Parham Sendi","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Simon J Anthony","author_inst":"Columbia University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.05.20146779","rel_title":"Rats and the COVID-19 pandemic: Early data on the global emergence of rats in response to social distancing","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.05.20146779","rel_abs":"Following widespread closures of food-related businesses due to efforts to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities reported increased sightings of rats in close vicinity of people. Because rats vector a number of pathogens transmissible to people, changes in their behavior has consequences for human health risks. To determine the extent of how stay-at-home measures influenced patterns of rat sightings we: 1) examined the number of rat-related public service requests before and during the period of lockdown in New York City (NYC) and Tokyo, Japan; 2) examined reports made in proximity to closed food service establishments in NYC; and 3) surveyed pest control companies in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Poland. During the month following lockdown, the overall number of reports decreased by 30% in NYC, while increasing 24% in Tokyo. However, new hotspots of 311 calls were observed in proximity of closed food service establishments in NYC; and there was a consistent positive association between kernel density estimates of food service establishments and location of 311 calls (r = 0.33 to 0.45). Similarly, more reports were observed in the restaurant-dense eastern side of Tokyo. Changes in clientele for pest control companies varied geographically, with 37% of pest-management companies surveyed in North America reporting 50-100% of their post-lockdown rat-related requests coming from new clients. In Warsaw, where there are no clusters of restaurants in densely-populated areas, there were no changes. In Tokyo, there were no changes in clients. We conclude that changes in public service calls are region-specific and localized, with increases in rat sightings more likely near restaurant-dense regions. Pest control companies surveyed in North America either lost much of their business or shifted clientele from old to new locations. We discuss possible mitigation measures including ramping up pest control during re-opening of food-related establishments and the need for citywide rodent surveillance and disease monitoring.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Parsons","author_inst":"Fordham University"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Kiyokawa","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Richardson","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Rafal Stryjek","author_inst":"Polish Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

Previous research has not been able to measure the broad range of potential stressors, nor examine whether recent changes in those stressors have positively or negatively impacted on common mental disorders. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the stressful impact of the lockdown on mental health has accumulated over time or whether people have adapted to the new conditions of lockdown. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first few months of lockdown related to the coronavirus pandemic and whether changes in CMD were associated with an increase in stressors related to lockdown and the pandemic. Methods: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (wave 9: 2017-2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 respectively), a representative sample of UK population, were analysed. Common mental disorders (CMD) were measured using the GHQ-12 (cut off >2) at all waves. The difference in the GHQ-12 (using Likert scores) between waves measured changes in psychological well-being. The incidence of CMD and changes in psychological well-being were analysed in relation to pandemic specific stressors and changes in economic, financial, household and psychosocial stressors. Findings: Around 30% of UKHLS adults without CMD in 2017\/9 had a CMD in April 2020. However from April to May 2020, the incidence reduced considerably to below 13%. Much of the increase in incident CMD between April and May was associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, but some of this increase was also associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home. The reduction in the incidence of many of these stressors in May (compared to April) coincided with a reduction in the incidence of CMD in May. Conclusion: The pandemic and resultant lockdown were associated with an increase in the incidence of CMD in the UK adult population initially in April 2020. These changes were associated with increases in feelings of loneliness and stressors related to work and domestic life and receipt of care. There was some evidence of adaptation to many of these stressors over the lockdown period by May 2020. However, if levels of unemployment and redundancy increase in the near future, the implications for the mental health of the population need careful thought and monitoring.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarani Chandola","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Meena Kumari","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Cara L Booker","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Michaela J Benzeval","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

The case and death rates are, for example, significantly positively associated with early cases from the beginning of the epidemic, the average age, the population density and the number of people employed in elderly care. By contrast, they are significantly negatively associated with the density of schoolchildren and infant care as well as the density of doctors. In addition, for individual variables significant spillover effects on the case numbers of neighbouring regions could be identified, which have a different sign than the overall effects and thus give cause for further analyses of the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 infections. The results complement the knowledge about COVID-19 infection beyond the clinical risk factors discussed so far by a socio-economic perspective. The findings can contribute to the targeted derivation of political measures and their review, as is currently being discussed in particular for the tourism and education sectors.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andree Ehlert","author_inst":"HWWI"},{"author_name":"Meena Kumari","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Cara L Booker","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Michaela J Benzeval","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

Massachusetts has been in the leading position of total cases since the outbreak in the U.S. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing sites access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city\/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: 1) residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black\/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COIVD-19 infections among minority; 2) The Black has the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Asian, and Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of testing location being accessed by all populations; 3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection; 4) Different from previous studies, elderly population rate is not statistically significant with incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hot spot regions of COVID-19 infections. The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Hu","author_inst":"Center for Geographic Analysis, Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Han Yue","author_inst":"Geocomputation Center for Social Science, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Changzhen Wang","author_inst":"Department of Geography and Anthropology, Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bing She","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Ye","author_inst":"Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning, Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Regina Liu","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Mercer University"},{"author_name":"Xinyan Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuming Bao","author_inst":"China Data Institute, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Masato Ootaki","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Tanikawa","author_inst":"Tokyo Pest Control Association"},{"author_name":"Faith E Parsons","author_inst":"CareSet Systems"},{"author_name":"Jason Munch-South","author_inst":"Fordham University"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin-Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Hirsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Parham Sendi","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Simon J Anthony","author_inst":"Columbia University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147009","rel_title":"Impact of COVID-19 Attributable Deaths on Longevity, Premature Mortality and DALY: Estimates of USA, Italy, Sweden and Germany","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147009","rel_abs":"In a short span of four months, the COVID-19 pandemic has added over 0.4 million deaths worldwide, which are untimely, premature and unwarranted.

Findings: The antibody response in terms of recognized epitopes is diverse, especially in oligosymptomatic patients, while the average strength of the antibody response of the population does correlate with the severity of the disease at each time point. Interpretation: The diverse immune response presents a challenge when conducting epidemiological studies as the used assays only detect 90% of the oligosymptomatic cases.

This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of the 358 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients was conducted. 226 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox regression method were utilized to control and adjust for confounding factors. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients were managed with hydroxychloroquine (HQ) plus antibiotics (n = 31) or conservative treatment (n = 195). Results: Kaplan-Meier curves drawn using propensity score-matched data revealed no differences between the length of time to viral clearance and duration of hospital stay between the two treatment arms (p=0.18, p=0.088). Multivariable Cox regression analysis similarly showed that time to viral clearance(Hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, [95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.67]) and symptom duration(HR 1.05, [95%-CI: 0.62-1.78]) were not different between groups. No severe adverse event or death was observed in either group. Conclusions: HQ with antibiotics was not associated with better clinical outcomes in terms of time to viral clearance, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms compared to conservative treatment alone. Large prospective randomized trials are necessary for definitive conclusions.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Ho An","author_inst":"Wando county health center and hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Seo Kim","author_inst":"Korea Uinversity, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yukyung park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Bong-Ok Kim","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Seok Ho Kang","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Korea University, School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Won Jun Kimn","author_inst":"Korea University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sung Kyu Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Hea-Woon Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjong Yang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Joonyoung Jang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Soonwoo Jang","author_inst":"Pusan National University"},{"author_name":"Tae-Ho Hwang","author_inst":"Director of Gene and Cell Therapy Research Center for Vessel-associated Diseases, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Christina Krebs","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Tanja Renz","author_inst":"Canton Basel-Landschaft Medical Association"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hochueli","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Haymoz","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Markus Hosch","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Nadine Periat","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Michele Richert","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Sesia","author_inst":"University Berne"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paris","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.20143123","rel_title":"Implementing a Negative Pressure Isolation Space within a Skilled Nursing Facility to Control SARS-CoV-2 Transmission","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.20143123","rel_abs":"Background: Isolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission. Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. Purpose: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. Basic Procedures: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. Main Findings: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic.

This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyse the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries. Methods: The Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned factors until June 29, 2020. Results: The correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity, CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r = 0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the correlation coefficient is r= 0.154. Conclusion: The great lethality of COVID-19 in western Europe and North America can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer and CVD percentage in these regions. It seems also plausible that the increased obesity in the USA and vitamin D deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ouail Ouchetto","author_inst":"Hassan II University - Casablanca"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Drissi Bourhanbour","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca"},{"author_name":"Joseph Wilson","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Clements","author_inst":"Well Living Lab, Rochester, Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Cedric Steiner","author_inst":"Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Won Jun Kimn","author_inst":"Korea University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sung Kyu Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Hea-Woon Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjong Yang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Joonyoung Jang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Soonwoo Jang","author_inst":"Pusan National University"},{"author_name":"Tae-Ho Hwang","author_inst":"Director of Gene and Cell Therapy Research Center for Vessel-associated Diseases, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Christina Krebs","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Tanja Renz","author_inst":"Canton Basel-Landschaft Medical Association"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hochueli","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Haymoz","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Markus Hosch","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Nadine Periat","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Michele Richert","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Sesia","author_inst":"University Berne"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paris","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141911","rel_title":"Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French Intensive Care Units according to antiviral strategies.

Methods Observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir\/ritonavir (L\/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or > 0). Results We analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L\/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P\/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having > or = 1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was frequent (64%), its incidence was different across the patients groups (P=0.01). In a post-hoc logistic multivariate regression apart from demographics characteristics and comorbidities, the use of L\/R (administered to 81 of 376 patients) was associated with occurrence of AKI (OR 2.07 CI95%:1.17-3.66) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Conclusion In this observational study of moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observed a benefit of treating patients with any specific antiviral treatment. We observed an association between L\/R treatment and occurrence of AKI and need for RRT.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Grimaldi","author_inst":"ERASME"},{"author_name":"Nadia Aissaoui","author_inst":"HEGP"},{"author_name":"Gauthier Blonz","author_inst":"CHD Vendee"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Carbutti","author_inst":"Jolimont"},{"author_name":"Romain Courcelle","author_inst":"La Louviere"},{"author_name":"Stephane Gaudry","author_inst":"CHU Avicenne"},{"author_name":"Julien Higny","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Horlait","author_inst":"Louvain"},{"author_name":"Sami Hraiech","author_inst":"APHM"},{"author_name":"Laurent Lefebvre","author_inst":"Aix En Provence"},{"author_name":"Francois Lejeune","author_inst":"Gosselies"},{"author_name":"Andre Ly","author_inst":"CHU Creteil"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147223","rel_title":"Predicting the second wave of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147223","rel_abs":"Marissa Renardy and Denise Kirschner University of Michigan Medical School The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact net- works based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa Renardy","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School"},{"author_name":"Denise E.
