Till date, well tested medication or antidote is not available to cure this disease. According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020 to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks. Based on the predictions for short-term interval, these models can be tuned for forecasting in long-term intervals.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Pandey","author_inst":"The NorthCap University"},{"author_name":"Poonam Chaudhary","author_inst":"TheNorthCap University"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050450","rel_title":"Reporting the life tracks of confirmed cases can effective prevent and control the COVID-19 outbreak in China","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050450","rel_abs":"Background: Since late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China.

Using Mann-Whitney U test, the provinces that reported the life tracks of confirmed cases to public had lower increased in daily new confirmed cases. Results: Compared with the paired province, Tianjin, Jilin, Gansu, Shanxi, Hainan and Guizhou had significant differences in the number of new confirmed cases and have lower mean rank (P<0.05). Shanghai had a lower mean rank (P=0.175) but no significant difference. Besides, the successful prevention and control work need other effective strategies, such as real time media coverage, isolating the suspected cases or close contacts, delaying the return of work, closing schools, wearing facial masks, and disinfecting the communities, et.al.

The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A\/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients' consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oliver J Hulme","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Eric-Jan Wagenmakers","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Per Damkier","author_inst":"Odense University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Fugl Madelung","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Hartwig Roman Siebner","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20048876","rel_title":"Japanese citizens' behavioral changes and preparedness against COVID-19: How effective is Japan's approach of self-restraint?","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20048876","rel_abs":"The Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking \"people's behavioral changes,\" in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, with a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral changes using various means to reach and influence them.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaori Muto","author_inst":"The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Isamu Yamamoto","author_inst":"Faculty of Business and Commerce, Keio University"},{"author_name":"Miwako Nagasu","author_inst":"Faculty of Economics, Keio University"},{"author_name":"Mikihito Tanaka","author_inst":"Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Koji Wada","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health International University of Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049668","rel_title":"Spatial variability in the risk of death from COVID-19 in Italy, 2020","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049668","rel_abs":"Objectives: Italy has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming the nation with the third highest death toll in the world as of May 10th, 2020. We analyzed the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across 20 Italian regions. Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 across 20 Italian regions. For each region, we estimated the crude case fatality ratio and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio (aCFR). We then assessed the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and transmission factors using multivariate regression analysis. Results: The overall aCFR in Italy was estimated at 17.4%. Lombardia exhibited the highest aCFR (24.7%) followed by Marche (19.3%), Emilia Romagna (17.7%) and Liguria (17.6%). Our aCFR estimate was greater than 10% for 12 regions. Our aCFR estimates were statistically associated with population density and cumulative morbidity rate in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Our aCFR estimates for overall Italy and for 7 out of 20 regions exceeded those reported for the most affected region in China. Our findings highlight the importance of social distancing to suppress incidence and reduce the death risk by preventing saturating the health care system.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Sushma Dahal","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mikihito Tanaka","author_inst":"Faculty of Political Science and Economics, Waseda University"},{"author_name":"Koji Wada","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medicine and Public Health International University of Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049007","rel_title":"Harmonizing heterogeneous endpoints in COVID-19 trials without loss of information - an essential step to facilitate decision making","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049007","rel_abs":"Background: Many trials are now underway to inform decision-makers on potential effects of treatments for COVID-19. To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results. Methods: We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir\/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. Results: There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir\/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days. A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up. Conclusion: Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maja von Cube","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of"},{"author_name":"Marlon Grodd","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Derek Hazard","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jerome Lambert","author_inst":"University of Paris, Paris, France; ECSTRA Team, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Research Centre UMR 1153, Inserm, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jannik Helweg-Larsen","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Quentin Gronau","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lars Benfield","author_inst":"Amager Hvidovre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046151","rel_title":"Clinical features, Diagnosis, and Treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046151","rel_abs":"Objectives: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020. Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19. Further prospective investigations are necessary.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Azin Tahvildari","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mahta Arbabi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Yeganeh Farsi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Parnian Jamshidi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Saba Hasanzadeh","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Tess Moore Calcagno","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami Florida"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Javad Nasiri","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Mirsaeidi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami Florida"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer H Madsen","author_inst":"Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049122","rel_title":"Globalized low-income countries may experience higher COVID-19 mortality rates","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049122","rel_abs":"Understanding the factors underpinning COVID-19 infection and mortality rates is essential in order to implement actions that help mitigate the current pandemia.

The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancy. Methods: Four databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched on March 25, 2020, using the following keywords: 'COVID-19', 'nCoV-2019', and 'coronavirus'. Articles included if they reported either the symptoms, treatments for the women who had been infected with the COVID-19 during their pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. The selected articles' results were summarized employing a narrative synthesis approach. Results: A total of nine studies were selected for this study, comprising 101 infected pregnant women. Other than the infected general population, infected pregnant women reported different symptoms; however, fever (66.7%), cough (39.4%), fatigue (15.2%), and breathing difficulties (14.1%) were common. Infected pregnant women were given different treatments than the general infected population. The C-section was a common (83.9%) mode of delivery among infected pregnant women, and a higher proportion of births were preterm births (30.4%) and low birth weight (17.9%). Conclusions: Pregnant infected women had different symptoms, and they were given dissimilar treatments than the general infected population. Healthcare providers may have appropriately informed about these symptoms and treatments. They, therefore, would be able to handle infection during pregnancy effectively, which would reduce common adverse consequences among infected pregnant women.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data from the United Kingdom and Spain. In the UK, we consider the National Health Service at the level of trusts and define a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates the four nearest neighbours of any given trust. In Spain we coarse-grain the healthcare system at the level of autonomous communities, and extract similar contact networks. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity. Our framework is general and flexible allowing for additional criteria, alternative cost functions, and can be extended to other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand, we show that it is possible to enable access to ICU for up to 1000 additional cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm. Under a more realistic and heterogeneous demand, our method is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system only using local sharing, and over 1300 using countrywide sharing, potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Lacasa","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Challen","author_inst":"EPSRC Centre for Predictive Modelling in Healthcare, University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models. Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Findings: We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only. Interpretation: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Kevin Van Zandvoort","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Amy Gimma","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, Denmark Hill, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel "},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049312","rel_title":"Projected ICU and Mortuary load due to COVID-19 in Sydney","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049312","rel_abs":"The spread of COVID-19 is expected to put a large strain on many hospital resources, including ICU bed space, and mortuary capacity.

Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306), minimum temperature (r=-0.347), and average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure. The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianfeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Municipal Institute of Labour Protections, Beijing Academy of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Linyuan Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ren","author_inst":"National Meteorological Information Center, China Meteorological Administration Meteorological Data Center"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050542","rel_title":"Using ILI surveillance to estimate state-specific case detection rates and forecast SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20050542","rel_abs":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied on RT-PCR testing. However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the syndromic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be less than 13%. If only 1\/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 sought care, the ILI surge would correspond to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three week period from March 8 to March 28. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin D Silverman","author_inst":"Penn State"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel Hupert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Alex D Washburne","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049130","rel_title":"Modelling the COVID-19 epidemics in Brasil: Parametric identification and public health measures influence","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049130","rel_abs":"A SIRU-type epidemic model is employed for the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemy evolution in Brazil, and analyse the influence of public health measures on simulating the control of this infectious disease. Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for a time variable functional form of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the initial phase of the data been employed for the parametric estimation and the remaining data being used for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, aimed at refining the values for the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals remain infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brazil from February 15th till March 29th, 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution from these initial conditions. As for the China analysis, the data for the reported cases in Brazil from March 30th till April 23rd are reserved for validation of the model. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at evaluating the effects on the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a more effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renato Machado Cotta","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Carolina Palma Naveira-Cotta","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"pierre magal","author_inst":"University of Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Caihong Xing","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Peihuan Qiao","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Chang","author_inst":"National Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Russell Thomson","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Rosalind Wang","author_inst":"Western Sydney University"},{"author_name":"Scott Bernstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Michael Soinelli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David S Park","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Larry Chinitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Lior Jankelosn","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20049155","rel_title":"Parametric analysis of early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected European countries","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20049155","rel_abs":"We analyze the early data on COVID-19 expansion in selected European countries using an analytical parametric model.

The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US). In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable.

At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Beckett","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ashley R Coenen","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"David Demory","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marian Dominguez-Mirazo","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Chung-Yin Leung","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Guanlin Li","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andreea Magalie","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Rogelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Shivam","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Conan Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20049692","rel_title":"The Effectiveness of Targeted Quarantine for Minimising Impact of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20049692","rel_abs":"We model the extent to which age targeted quarantine can be used to reduce ICU admissions caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19.

Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-items self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Of 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 {+\/-} 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category <25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.

Design: A cross-sectional survey Setting: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants: 2,108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Data were collected between March 17 and 18 2020. Main outcome measures: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including the number of respondents and the weighted percentages. Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social-distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) willingness and (4) ability to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1,992 (94.2%) respondents reported taking at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social-distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 compared to younger adults aged 18 to 34 years (aOR:1.9; 95% CI:1.1 to 3.4). Those with the lowest household income were six times less likely to be able to work from home (aOR:0.16; 95% CI:0.09 to 0.26) and three times less likely to be able to self-isolate (aOR:0.31; 95% CI:0.16 to 0.58). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR:0.47; 95% CI:0.27 to 0.82). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions The ability to adopt and comply with certain NPIs is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socio-economic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Leigh Bowman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Vrinten","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philippa Pristera","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guanlin Li","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Andreea Magalie","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sang Woo Park","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Rogelio Rodriguez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shashwat Shivam","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Conan Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20048561","rel_title":"Use of siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20048561","rel_abs":"Background Severe COVID-19 is characterised by interstitial pneumonia and hyperinflammation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. Effective treatments are urgently needed, and IL-6 is a rational target to reduce hyperinflammation. Methods An observational, control cohort, single-centre study initiated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy included patients with COVID-19 confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA and interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Patients were treated with either best supportive care and siltuximab or best supportive care alone. Propensity score matching was applied to minimise differences in baseline covariates between patient cohorts. The main outcome was mortality in siltuximab-treated patients compared with patients in the matched-control cohort. This study (Siltuximab in Severe COVID-19, SISCO) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04322188. Findings Thirty patients received siltuximab, while 188 control patients received only best supportive care. Siltuximab-treated patients were matched to 30 control patients using the propensity score analysis of baseline covariates. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the siltuximab-treated than the matched-control cohort patients (HR 0.462, 95% CI 0.221-0.965); p=0.0399). The mean follow-up was 33.3 days (range 7-58 days) for the siltuximab-treated patients and 22.8 days (range 2-45 days) for the control cohort. Sixteen siltuximab-treated patients were discharged from hospital, four remained on mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients died. Interpretation Patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support may benefit from treatment with siltuximab to reduce mortality and cytokine-driven hyperinflammation associated with severe disease. These findings require validation in a randomised controlled clinical trial. Funding Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital and the Italian Association for Cancer Research funded the study. EUSA Pharma supplied siltuximab, and provided funding for data collection, analysis, and development of the publication.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Gritti","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Diego Ripamonti","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ivano Riva","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Landi","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Alborghetti","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Frigeni","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.

Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma S McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Meehan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"James M Trauer","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.
