Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"NISREEN M.A. OKBA","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Marcel A Muller","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Wentao Li","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Wang","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Corine H.

Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19\/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34\/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided to confirm 4 patients with COVID-19 from 52 suspects who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR and 7 patients from 148 close contacts with negative RT-PCR. Conclusion IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection. The serological diagnosis criterion of seroconversion or [&ge;] 4-fold increase in the IgG titer is suitable for a majority of COVID-19 patients. Serologic test is helpful for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspects and close contacts.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quan-xin Long","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of

Methods We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings. Results Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healthcare or other settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend < 0.001). Conclusions High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized social distancing measures are required. Rapid reduction of transmissibility over time implies that prolonged hospitalization of mild cases might not be necessary in large epidemics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao-Yuan Cheng","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Shu-Wan Jian","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. METHODSWe established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies\/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies\/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lianhua Dong","author_inst":"National institute of metrology"},{"author_name":"Junbo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Niu","author_inst":"National institute of metrology, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sitong Sheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yongzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Livio Fenga","author_inst":"ISTAT"},{"author_name":"Junbo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Chunyan Niu","author_inst":"National institute of metrology, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Institute for Infectious Disease and Endemic Disease Control, Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Sitong Sheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yongzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Yang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

This study aims to explore the association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) death and weather parameters. Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19. Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = -0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively. Conclusion In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yueling Ma","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yadong Zhao","author_inst":"Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiangtao Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao He","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shihua Fu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jingping Niu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Beam Dowd","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Valentina Rotondi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Liliana Andriano","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David M Brazel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Per Block","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Ding","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Melinda C Mills","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Manqing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Detection, Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd,Wuhan Considerin Gene Health Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ka Chun Chong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Cheng","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Feng Ling","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kirran Mohammad","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Benny Zee","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lei Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xi Xiong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hengyan Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Wang","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Enfu Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen HYK Gene Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Peng","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xie","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yunhua Gao","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Di Wang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhao","author_inst":"School of Life Science, Chongqing University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Dai","author_inst":"National institute of metrology China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Fang","author_inst":"National Institute of Metrology"},{"author_name":"Jiang-lin Xiang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies is critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID-19 reported cases show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-04-05; daily updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092; respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy (2020-04-04), about 13.3% of confirmed cases passed away.

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the US.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Sean M.

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \"daily settlement\" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, \"daily settlement\" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qing Xie","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianling You","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Zhijian Tian","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianjuan Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Dong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"MGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Ye Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Mu","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Lachmann","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Jagodnik","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Federico Manuel Giorgi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Forest Ray","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhou","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Zhijian Tian","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Wu","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Jianjuan Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Dong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"MGI-Wuhan, Wuhan 430075, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Ye Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Mu","author_inst":"MGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China"},{"author_name":"Hong-xin Du","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Hua-wen Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital."},{"author_name":"Xiao-he Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Shao-bo Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-ping Cui","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhou","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Cheng-jun Xue","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Using negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general adult population as well as samples from COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that these assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma\/serum as early as two days post COVID19 symptoms onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Such serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers may, in the future, also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stadlbauer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shirin Strohmeier","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thi Nguyen","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection & Immunity, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Veronika Chromikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kaijun Jiang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Guha Asthagiri-Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

This summary may help to understand the disease dynamics in the early phase of COVID19 outbreak, therefore, to guide future public health measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mahen Perera","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kenrie Hui","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Michael Chan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik Peiris","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Leo Poon","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Results The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch\/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P<0.004). Conclusions The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch\/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xue Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Yawei Niu","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Xiong Li","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Cai","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Yucan Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Mental Health Center, School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Liao","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan Normal University, Haikou, Hainan, China"},{"author_name":"Edwin Wang","author_inst":"Cumming School Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, T2N 4N1, Canada"},{"author_name":"Denise Jurczyszak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jose Polanco","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Maria Bermudez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Giulio Kleiner","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Teresa Aydillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977). Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to pay more attention on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations during COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuchen Ying","author_inst":"Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, P.R.

Objective: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or >=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or \"Other\"), and all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020. Results: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924\/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540\/2,988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015\/2,986) of US participants had a total household income between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223\/2,988) of UK participants had a total household income between GBP15,000 and GBP74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1% - 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was 'highly effective' in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% - 31.3%) of UK participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% - 55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% - 40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal Geldsetzer","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Fanqian Kong","author_inst":"Department of medical record and statistics, Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital, Ningbo,Zhejiang 315041, P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Zhu","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo 315020, P.R.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 1609 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated during the early transmission phase, 32 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and found clustered into nine mutant types under high positive selection pressure. Applying molecular dynamics simulations, three mutant types (V367F, W436R, N354D\/D364Y) displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2, likely due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of one mutant (V367F) circulating worldwide was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G), which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junxian Ou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Zhonghua Zhou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, College of Life Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Ruixue Dai","author_inst":"Fudan University Department of Environmental Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Shan Zhao","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, China"},{"author_name":"Wendong Lan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Lilian Cui","author_inst":"Novoprotein Scientific Inc"},{"author_name":"Jianguo Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, China"},{"author_name":"Donald Seto","author_inst":"Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA 20110, USA"},{"author_name":"James Chodosh","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Howe Laboratory Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Gong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, College of Life Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Qiwei Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fierer","author_inst":"daniel.fierer@mssm.edu"},{"author_name":"Luz Amarilis Lugo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erna Milunka Kojic","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Stoever","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sean T.H.

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

We expressed three versions of spike (S) proteins--receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and S ectodomain--in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 [A] proximal to viral membrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qingbing Zheng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dinghui Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Xue","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuyun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofen Huang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Zhou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghui Zha","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiping Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Sun","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Deng","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yingbin Wang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yixin Chen","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qinjian Zhao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ying Gu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shaowei Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki \/ Medicum"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moran","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Xiao-feng Li","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing, China;"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia-mao Liu","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin-jing Li","author_inst":"The Second Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"De-chun Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Wanzhou People Hosptital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xue-fei Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.
