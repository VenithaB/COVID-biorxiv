Several viral respiratory infections - notably influenza - are associated with secondary bacterial infection and additional pathology. The extent to which this applies for COVID-19 is unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to define the bacteria causing secondary pneumonias in COVID-19 ICU patients using the FilmArray Pneumonia Panel, and to determine this tests potential in COVID-19 management. Methods. COVID-19 ICU patients with clinically-suspected secondary infection at 5 UK hospitals were tested with the FilmArray at point of care. We collected patient demographic data and compared FilmArray results with routine culture. Results. We report results of 110 FilmArray tests on 94 patients (16 had 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) were male, the median age was 59 yrs; 92 were ventilated. Median hospital stay before testing was 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests were positive, with 141 bacteria detected. Most were Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) or Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), as is typical of hospital and ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), were rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus\/Enterovirus) and no atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) were positive by routine culture, and fewer species were reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained the most prevalent pathogens. Conclusion. FilmArray had a higher diagnostic yield than culture for ICU COVID-19 patients with suspected secondary pneumonias. The bacteria found mostly were Enterobacterales, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as in typical HAP\/VAP, but with Klebsiella spp. more prominent. We found almost no viral co-infection. Turnaround from sample to results is around 1h 15 min compared with the usual 72h for culture, giving prescribers earlier data to inform antimicrobial decisions.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zaneeta Dhesi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Virve I Enne","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"David Brealey","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David M Livermore","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Juliet High","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Russell","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Antony Colles","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Hala Kandil","author_inst":"Watford General Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Damien Mack","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Martin","author_inst":"Peninsula Medical School, University of Plymouth"},{"author_name":"Valerie Page","author_inst":"Watford General Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert Parker","author_inst":"Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerry Roulston","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suveer Singh","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Wey","author_inst":"Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ann Marie Swart","author_inst":"Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Susan Stirling","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Julie A Barber","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Justin O'Grady","author_inst":"Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park"},{"author_name":"Vanya A Gant","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20132944","rel_title":"Clinical predictors of donor antibody titer and correlation with recipient antibody response in a COVID-19 convalescent plasma clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20132944","rel_abs":"Background: Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results: Mean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9 and 7.8% (8\/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p<0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3% (p=0.02). Conclusion: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Lucia L Madariaga","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jenna Guthmiller","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Stephen Schrantz","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Maud Jansen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chancey Christenson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Madan Kumar","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Micah Prochaska","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136580","rel_title":"Estimation of Undetected Symptomatic and Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 Infection and prediction of its spread in USA","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136580","rel_abs":"The reported COVID-19 cases in the USA have crossed over 2 million, and a large number of infected cases are undetected whose estimation can be done if country-wide antibody testing is performed. In this work, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by modeling and simulation approach. We propose a new epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers Symptomatic, Purely Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the lockdown conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of total number of confirmed, active and death, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study also demonstrates the possibility of a second wave of the infection if social distancing regulations are relaxed to a large extent. We estimate that around 12.7 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 17.7 million (range: 16.3-19.2) people, or 5.3% (range: 4.9-5.8) of the population will be infected by when the disease spread ends in the USA.

We also project the epidemic curve considering realistic quarantine, social distancing, and possible medication scenarios. We use a deterministic epidemic model that includes asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated, and medicated population compartments for our analysis. We calculate the basic reproduction number R0 for the pre and post lockdown periods, noting that during this time, no medication was available. The pre-lock down the value of R0 is estimated to be 1.07, and the post lockdown value is estimated to be 1.86. We use this analysis to project the epidemic curve for a variety of lockdown, social distancing, and medication scenarios. We note that if no substantial efforts are made to contain the epidemic, it will peak in mid of September, with the maximum projected active cases being close to 700,000. In a realistic, best-case scenario, we project that the epidemic peaks in early to mid-July with the maximum active cases being around 120000.We note that social distancing measures and medication, if available, will help flatten the curve, however without the reintroduction of further lockdown, it would be very difficult to bring R0 below 1. Our study strongly supports the recent WHO recommendation of reintroducing lockdowns to control the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohsin Ali","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science & Technology, Mishref, Kuwait;"},{"author_name":"Adnan Khan","author_inst":"Lahore University of Management Sciences Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Maud Jansen","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Chancey Christenson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Madan Kumar","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Micah Prochaska","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136606","rel_title":"Extension and implementation of a system modelling the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136606","rel_abs":"We modelling the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic taking into account the role of the unreported cases.

Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures. Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic. Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters. Conclusion: Lockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lia Mayorga","author_inst":"IHEM"},{"author_name":"Clara Garcia","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Flores","author_inst":"Eventbrite"},{"author_name":"Sofia Masuelli","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Maria Victoria Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina y Biologia Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU), Centro Cientifico y Tecnologico de Mendoza (CCT-Mendoza), CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.20.20136382","rel_title":"Behavioral changes before lockdown, and decreased retail and recreation mobility during lockdown, contributed most to the successful control of the COVID-19 epidemic in 35 Western countries","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.20.20136382","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koen Deforche","author_inst":"Emweb bv"},{"author_name":"Jurgen Vercauteren","author_inst":"KULeuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Institute for "},{"author_name":"Viktor M\u00fcller","author_inst":"Insitute of Biology, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Anne-Mieke Vandamme","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Institute for"},{"author_name":"Maria Victoria Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina y Biologia Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU), Centro Cientifico y Tecnologico de Mendoza (CCT-Mendoza), CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136705","rel_title":"Healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and views about support during COVID-19 and comparable pandemics: A rapid review and meta-synthesis","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136705","rel_abs":"Healthcare workers across the world have risen to the demands of treating COVID-19 patients, potentially at significant cost to their own health and wellbeing.

This rapid review identified 40 qualitative studies which have explored healthcare workers experiences and views from previous pandemics, including and comparable to COVID-19. Meta-synthesis of this qualitative data using thematic analysis derived eight key themes which transcended pandemics, time, and geographical boundaries. This pandemic is not unprecedented; the themes that arose from previous pandemics were remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of COVID-19 globally today. We have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of these previous pandemics, mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce worldwide.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo Billings","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Brian Chi Fung Ching","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Gkofa","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Talya Greene","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Bloomfield","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Cristian G Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales"},{"author_name":"Luis S Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Wool","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Amy Durkin","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Won Hee Oh","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Laura Trockman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Janani Vigneswaran","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Keskey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Dustin G Shaw","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Haley Dugan","author_inst":"Unviversity of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136598","rel_title":"Chest X-ray classification using Deep learning for automated COVID-19 screening","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136598","rel_abs":"In today's world, we find ourselves struggling to fight one of the worst pandemics in the history of humanity known as COVID-2019 caused by a coronavirus. If we detect the virus at an early stage (before it enters the lower respiratory tract), the patient can be treated quickly. Once the virus reaches the lungs, we observe ground-glass opacity in the chest X-ray due to fibrosis in the lungs. Due to the significant differences between X-ray images of an infected and non-infected person, artificial intelligence techniques can be used to identify the presence and severity of the infection. We propose a classification model that can analyze the chest X-rays and help in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Our methodology classifies the chest X-rays into 4 classes viz. normal, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. Further, the X-rays indicating COVID-19 are classified on severity-basis into mild, medium, and severe. The deep learning model used for the classification of pneumonia, TB, and normal is VGG16 with an accuracy of 95.9 %. For the segregation of normal pneumonia and COVID-19, the DenseNet-161 was used with an accuracy of 98.9 %. ResNet-18 worked best for severity classification achieving accuracy up to 76 %. Our approach allows mass screening of the people using X-rays as a primary validation for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ankita Shelke","author_inst":"K. J.

Unlike many other countries, the UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission were still high, and this could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. However thus far, the likely impacts of easing restrictions at this point in the pandemic have not been quantified. Using a Bayesian model, we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number (R) remains <1 in line with the UK governments stated aim. Methods: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown. Findings: The model inferred an R of 0.752 on the 13th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 257 (95% 108-492) deaths and 26,447 (95% CI 11,105-50,549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying <1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 3,174 (95% 1,334-6,060) excess cumulative deaths and 421,310 (95% 177,012-804,811) excess cases. Results: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains <1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and health care services in England. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R below 1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England. This study provides urgently needed information for developing public health policy for the next stages of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisham Ziauddeen","author_inst":"Dept. of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Naresh Subramaniam","author_inst":"Dept. of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge UK"},{"author_name":"Deepti Gurdasani","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Long Chu","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"James Camac","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Talha Chafekar","author_inst":"K.

The outbreak of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate its original transmissibility with basic reproductive number (R0) and the effectiveness of containment measures. The traditional deterministic approach for estimating R0 is based on the outbreak of a large population size rather than that a small cohort of cruise ship. The parameters are therefore fraught with uncertainty. To tackle this problem, we developed a Bayesian Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with ordinary differential equation (ODE) to estimate three parameters, including transmission coefficients, the latent period, and the recovery rate given the uncertainty implicated the outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship with modest population size. Based on the estimated results on these three parameters before the introduction of partial containment measures, the natural epidemic curve after intervention was predicted and compared with the observed curve in order to assess the efficacy of containment measures. With the application of the Bayesian model to the empirical data on COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, the R0 was estimated as high as 5.71(95% credible interval: 4.08-7.55) because of its aerosols and fomite transmission mode. The simulated trajectory shows the entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 34% (95% credible interval: 31-36%) infected passengers. Such a discovery provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine with decontamination for containing other cruise ships and warship outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Emergency Department of Taipei City Hospital, Ren-Ai Branch, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Hsiao-Hsuan Jen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chang-Chuan Chan","author_inst":"Institute of Environmental and Occupational Health Science, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Ninad Mehendale","author_inst":"K.

It is not yet well defined whether patient groups at increased risk of severe respiratory disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection also experience a heightened incidence of cardiac complications. Objective: We sought to analyse the role of pre-existing chronic disease (chronic respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes mellitus) in the development of cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2. Data Sources: We retrospectively investigated published (including pre-prints), publicly released, de-identified, data made available between Dec 1, 2019, and May 11, 2020. Information was accessed from PubMed, Embase, medRxiv and SSRN. Study Selection: 379 full-text articles were reviewed and 321 excluded for lack of original research, irrelevance to outcome, inappropriate cohort, or small patient numbers (case reports of <10 patients). Data were extracted from two studies and the remaining 56 contacted to request appropriate data, to which three responded with data contributions. A final of five studies were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and MOOSE statements. Included studies were critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Data were extracted independently by multiple observers. A fixed-effects model was selected for the meta-analysis based on relatively low heterogeneity between the studies (I2<50%). Main Outcome and Measures: Cardiac complications were determined via blood levels of cardiac biomarkers above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, abnormalities in electrocardiography, and\/or abnormalities in echocardiography. Results: SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who developed cardiac complications were, on average, 10 years older than those that did not. Pooled analyses showed the development of cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2 was significantly increased in patients with underlying chronic respiratory illness (OR 2.88[1.45,5.71]), CVD (OR 5.12[3.09,8.48]), hypertension (OR 4.37[2.99,6.39]) and diabetes mellitus (OR 2.61[1.67,4.09]). Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and pre-existing chronic respiratory illness, CVD, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus may represent prognostic factors for the development of additional cardiac complications in COVID-19, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease patient management and providing justification for a larger scale observational study.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jane E Sinclair","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Yanshan Zhu","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Ma","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, and School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Shi","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Kun-Long Ma","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yongchuan, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chun-Feng Cao","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yongchuan, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ling-Xi Kong","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yongchuan, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ke-Qiang Wan","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yongchuan, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Liao","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yongchuan, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Qiang Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Integrative Medicine, Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xi'an Shaanxi Province, China"},{"author_name":"Matt Arentz","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, U.S.A"},{"author_name":"Meredith Redd","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, and School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.20136903","rel_title":"Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are associated with greater disease severity: results of a local audit of practice.","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.20136903","rel_abs":"Objectives: To audit implementation of a local protocol for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) among patients hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including an assessment of the prevalence of VDD in these patients, and of potential associations with disease severity and fatality. Design: This was not a study or clinical trial, but rather a retrospective interim audit (Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals Registration No. 10075) of a local clinical care pathway for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related illness. The Information (Caldicott) Guardian permitted these data to be shared beyond the confines of our institution. Setting: A large tertiary academic NHS Foundation Trust in the North East of England, UK, providing care to COVID-19 patients. Participants: One hundred thirty-four hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19 infection. Main outcome measures: Adherence to local investigation and treatment protocol; prevalence of VDD, and relationship of baseline serum 25(OH)D with markers of COVID-19 severity and inpatient fatality versus recovery. Results: 55.8% of eligible patients received Colecalciferol replacement, albeit not always loaded as rapidly as our protocol suggested, and no cases of new hypercalcaemia occurred following treatment. Patients admitted to ITU were younger than those managed on medical wards (61.1 years +\/- 11.8 vs. 76.4 years +\/- 14.9, p<0.001), with greater prevalence of hypertension, and higher baseline respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score-2 and C-reactive protein level. While mean serum 25(OH)D levels were comparable [i.e. ITU: 33.5 nmol\/L +\/- 16.8 vs. Non-ITU: 48.1 nmol\/L +\/- 38.2, mean difference for Ln-transformed-25(OH)D: 0.14, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (-0.15, 0.41), p=0.3], only 19% of ITU patients had 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol\/L vs. 60.9% of non-ITU patients (p=0.02). However, we found no association with fatality, potentially due to small sample size, limitations of no-trial data and, potentially, the prompt diagnosis and treatment of VDD. Conclusions: Subject to the inherent limitations of observational (non-trial) audit data, analysed retrospectively, we found that patients requiring ITU admission were more frequently vitamin D deficient than those managed on medical wards, despite being significantly younger. Larger prospective studies and\/or clinical trials are needed to elucidate the role of vitamin D as a preventive and\/or therapeutic strategy for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 infection in patients with VDD.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grigorios Panagiotou","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Su Ann Tee","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Yasir Ihsan","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Waseem Athar","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Marchitelli","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Donna Kelly","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Christopher S.

This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the effectiveness of the measures adopted at the institution. Methods: This is a prospective study carried out from 11\/04\/2020 to 19\/06\/2020. Investigated 346 patients between zero and eighteen years old, with analysis of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, obtained from a nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, attended at a highly complex public pediatric hospital in the city of Sao Paulo. Protocols for clinical management and treatment of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adopted during the assistance and implementation of a preoperative screening protocol. They were evaluated according to sex, age, epidemiology, presence of comorbidities, clinical manifestations, therapy used, need for hospitalization in the ward and ICU, use of mechanical ventilation (MV) and evolution. Results: 66 confirmed patients with COVID 19 were identified. Median age was 7 years old, with the male gender predominant (2:1). 27 patients (40.9%) had contact with symptomatic respiratory individuals, comorbidity occurred in 50 cases (75.8%). Main clinical manifestations were: fever, 37 patients (56.1%); cough, 23 (34.8%); respiratory distress in 10 (15.2%) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 24 (36.4%). 38 patients (57.6%) received antibiotics and 13 (19.7%) received corticotherapy. 37 patients (56.1%) required hospitalization, eight (19.5%) in the ICU and six (75%) requiring MV. One death occurred and others with good evolution. Conclusion: This study corroborates the perception that the pediatric patient has a more benign manifestation, even in the presence of comorbidities, requiring the screening of surgical patients. The protocol adopted by the institution proved to be effective, with no contamination being observed among patients or between patients and collaborators.

Methods: An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during May 2-8, 2020, six weeks after a Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. Findings: Adults' health condition had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression and distress. Reported test availability for COVID-19 (from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\" ) also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. Interpretation: Adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, especially adults at the lower end of the health spectrum. Test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults experiencing poor COVID-19 test availability. The significant predictions of health condition and COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify psychiatric risk factors directly from health related variables during a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huiyang Dai","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X.

We examined trends in mental health and health behaviours in the UK before and during the initial phase of the COVID-19 lockdown and differences across population subgroups. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, including representative samples of adults (aged 18+) interviewed in four survey waves between 2015 and 2020 (n=48,426). 9,748 adults had complete data for longitudinal analyses. Outcomes included psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ)), loneliness, current cigarette smoking, use of e-cigarettes and alcohol consumption. Cross-sectional prevalence estimates were calculated and multilevel Poisson regression assessed associations between time period and the outcomes of interest, as well as differential associations by age, gender, education level and ethnicity. Results: Psychological distress increased one month into lockdown with the prevalence rising from 19.4% (95% CI 18.7%-20.0%) in 2017-19 to 30.3% (95% CI 29.1%-31.6%) in April 2020 (RR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1,1.4). Groups most adversely affected included women, young adults, people from an Asian background and those who were degree educated. Loneliness remained stable overall (RR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.6,1.5). Smoking declined (RR=0.9, 95% CI=0.8,1.0) and the proportion of people drinking four or more times per week increased (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.3,1.5), as did binge drinking (RR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3,1.7). Conclusions: Psychological distress increased one month into lockdown, particularly among women and young adults. Smoking declined, but adverse alcohol use generally increased. Effective measures are required to mitigate adverse impacts on health.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Michael Green","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Michaela Benzeval","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Desmond Campbell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Peter Craig","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Alastair H Leyland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Anna Pearce","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Thomson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Elise Whitley","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Richard Quinton","author_inst":"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Meredith Redd","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, and School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137075","rel_title":"The validation of the original and modified Caprini score in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137075","rel_abs":"Objective. The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed infection. Methods. The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with the implemented Caprini score and were evaluated retrospectively. The score was calculated twice: by the physician at the admission and by the investigator at discharge or after death. The second calculation at discharge, considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2 points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic and 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer, were evaluated in a retrospective manner. The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or dissection. The secondary endpoint included the unfavorable outcome as a combination of symptomatic VTE, admission to the intensive care unit, the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with outcomes was evaluated. Results. Totally 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3{+\/-}12.7 years old) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died up to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12 (5.4{+\/-}1.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.9{+\/-}2.5) at discharge or death. The presence of the virus increased these scores and resulted in an increased score with the maximal value for those including COVID-19 points (10.0{+\/-}3.0). Patients received prophylactic (2.4%), intermediate (76.8%), or therapeutic (20.8%) doses of enoxaparin. Despite this, the symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) and unfavorable outcomes in 31 (18.5%) patients. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with VTE with the highest predictability for the original scale when assessed at discharge. Supplementation of the original score by elevated D-dimer improved predictability only at the admission. Four versions of the Caprini score calculated at the admission had a significant correlation with the unfavorable outcome with the minor advantages of specific COVID-19 points. Conclusion. The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE or unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients. All models, including specific COVID-19 scores, showed high predictability with minor differences.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergey Tsaplin","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Ilya Schastlivtsev","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Kirill Lobastov","author_inst":"Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sergey Zhuravlev","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital no.1 (Volynskaya) of the President's Administration of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Victor Barinov","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital no.1 (Volynskaya) of the President's Administration of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation"},{"author_name":"Joseph Caprini","author_inst":"University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA"},{"author_name":"Alastair H Leyland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Anna Pearce","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Thomson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Elise Whitley","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Richard Quinton","author_inst":"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Meredith Redd","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, and School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20136838","rel_title":"First results from the UK COVID-19 Serology in Oncology Staff Study (CSOS)","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20136838","rel_abs":"Background: The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial worldwide mortality.

Methods: Patient-facing staff working in an oncology department during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large district general hospital in the East of England were invited to participate. Samples were collected during the first week of June 2020: blood for SARS-COV-2 antibody testing using a rapid lateral flow point of care (POC) assay and a laboratory Luminex based assay, as well as a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Participant characteristics were also collected. Results: Seventy participants were recruited: nurses (45\/70; 64.3%), doctors (15\/70; 21.2%), and other patient-facing staff (10\/70; 14.3%). The majority were female (61\/70; 87.1%) with a mean age of 42 years (median 41; range 23-64 years). A minority were smokers (9\/70; 10%) or had chronic underlying health conditions (16\/70; 22.9%), the commonest being asthma. All participants were nasopharyngeal-swab PCR negative, although 4\/70 (5.7%) had previously tested positive by NHS testing undertaken during the preceding months. 15\/70 (21.4%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Luminex test. Nurses had the highest incidence of positive antibodies (13\/45; 28.9%), with a lower incidence in doctors (2\/15; 13.3%) although this difference was not statistically significant (Fischer's exact test p=0.3). No receptionists had positive antibody tests. All four participants with a previously reported positive PCR test were antibody-positive. 9\/15 (60%) of antibody-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 3.6-fold higher odds than antibody-negative participants, of whom 16\/55 reported symptoms (p=0.03). The mean duration of symptoms was 11 days (median 11; range 1-35 days) and the mean time from resolution of reported previous symptoms to antibody testing was 48.4 days (median 46; range 1-123 days). Conclusion: This study establishes the SARS-CoV-2 exposure and carriage rate amongst patient-facing staff working in the oncology department of a large UK general hospital during the pandemic. These results may help inform UK national oncology patient management prior to the development of a viable vaccine or treatment.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Favara","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anthony Cooke","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Rainer Doffinger","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sally Houghton","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ieva Budriunaite","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Bossingham","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Karen McAdam","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola L Ainsworth","author_inst":"The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elise Whitley","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Richard Quinton","author_inst":"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Meredith Redd","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, and School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20137950","rel_title":"Using Machine Learning to assess Covid-19 risks","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20137950","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT: IMPORTANCE: Identifying potential Covid-19 patients in the general population is a huge challenge at the moment. Given the low availability of infected Covid-19 patients clinical data, it is challenging to understand and comprehend similar and complex patterns in these symptomatic patients. Laboratory testing for Covid19 antigen with RT-PCR | (Reverse Transcriptase) is not possible or economical for whole populations. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Covid risk stratifier model that classifies people into different risk cohorts, based on their symptoms and validate the same. DESIGN: Analysis of Covid cases across Wuhan and New York were done to identify the course of these cases prior to being symptomatic and being hospitalised for the infection. A dataset based on these statistics were generated and was then fed into an unsupervised learning algorithm to reveal patterns and identify similar groups of people in the population. Each of these cohorts were then classified and identified into three risk levels that were validated against the real world cases and studies. SETTING: The study is based on general population. PARTICIPANTS: The adult population were considered for the analysis, development and validation of the model RESULTS: Of 1 million observations generated, 20% of them exhibited Covid symptoms and patterns, and 80% of them belonged to the asymptomatic and non-infected group of people. Upon clustering, three clinically obvious clusters were obtained, out of which the Cluster A had 20% of the symptomatic cases that were classified into one cohort, the other two cohorts, Cluster B had people with no symptoms but with high number of comorbidities and Cluster C had people with few leading indicators for the infection with few comorbidities. This was then validated against 300 participants whose data we collected as a part of a research study through our Covid-research tool and about 92% of them were classified correctly. CONCLUSION: A model was developed and validated that classifies people into Covid risk categories based on their symptoms. This can be used to monitor and track cases that rapidly transition into being symptomatic which eventually get tested positive for the infection in order to initiate early medical interventions.

We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in healthcare, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown. Methods: In population-based electronic health records for 1 958 638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)population infection rate, and (iii)relative impact on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body-mass index(BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions(cardiovascular diseases, CVD; diabetes; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD and chronic kidney disease, CKD), accounting for confounders. Findings: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 383 to 767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR=1.2. Due to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97 755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434 104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) individuals would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year. Interpretation: Prevention of obesity and physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alvina Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Pippa Corrie","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicola L Ainsworth","author_inst":"The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elise Whitley","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Richard Quinton","author_inst":"University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Meredith Redd","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Linda A Gallo","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, and School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Nai Zheng","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mari Cobb","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Henry Utset","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jiaolong Wang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Olivia Stovicek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cindy Bethel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Scott Matushek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mihai Giurcanu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Beavis","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Diego diSabato","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"David Meltzer","author_inst":"The University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark Ferguson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John P Kress","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kumaran Shanmugarajah","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Matthews","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137448","rel_title":"Humidity and deposition solution play a critical role in virus inactivation by heat treatment on N95 respirators","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137448","rel_abs":"Supply shortages of N95 respirators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have motivated institutions to develop feasible and effective N95 respirator reuse strategies. In particular, heat decontamination is a treatment method that scales well and can be implemented in settings with variable or limited resources. Prior studies using multiple inactivation methods, however, have often focused on a single virus under narrowly defined conditions, making it difficult to develop guiding principles for inactivating emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses. We systematically explored how temperature, humidity, and virus deposition solutions impact the inactivation of viruses deposited and dried on N95 respirator coupons. We exposed four virus surrogates across a range of structures and phylogenies, including two bacteriophages (MS2 and phi6), a mouse coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus, MHV), and a recombinant human influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (IAV), to heat treatment for 30 minutes in multiple deposition solutions across several temperatures and relative humidities (RH). We observed that elevated RH was essential for effective heat inactivation of all four viruses tested. For heat treatments between 72{degrees}C and 82{degrees}C, RH greater than 50% resulted in > 6-log10 inactivation of bacteriophages and RH greater than 25% resulted in > 3.5-log10 inactivation of MHV and IAV. Furthermore, deposition of viruses in host cell culture media greatly enhanced virus inactivation by heat and humidity compared to other deposition solutions such as phosphate buffered saline, phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin, and human saliva. Past and future heat treatment methods or technologies must therefore explicitly account for deposition solutions as a factor that will strongly influence observed virus inactivation rates. Overall, our data set can inform the design and validation of effective heat-based decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and other porous surfaces, especially for emerging or low-titer viruses that may be of immediate public health concern such as SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicole Rockey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https:\/\/phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk\/COVID19\/. Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes in blood proteins that associate with disease severity can potentially be used as early biomarkers to monitor disease severity in COVID-19 and serve as potential therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamel Patel","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Ashton","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Lars-magnus Anderson","author_inst":"Sahlgrenska university hospital"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gisslen","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Keith S.

We present a means to optimize a forecasting model by functionalizing our previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model with SEIR-like parameters. Conversely, SEIR models can be adapted to better incorporate real-time data. Methods: Our previously reported asymmetric Gaussian model was shown to greatly improve on forecasting accuracy relative to use of symmetric functions, such as Gaussian and error functions for death rates and cumulative deaths, respectively. However, the reported asymmetric Gaussian implementation, which fitted well to the ascent and much of the recovery side of the real death rate data, was not agile enough to respond to changing social behavior that is resulting in persistence of infections and deaths in the later stage of recovery. We have introduced a time-dependent {sigma}(t) parameter to account for transmission rate variability due to the effects of behavioral changes such as social distancing and subsequent social easing. The {sigma}(t) parameter is analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 (infection factor) that is evidently not a constant during the progression of COVID-19 for a particular population. The popularly used SEIR model and its many variants are also incorporating a time dependent R0(t) to better describe the effects of social distancing and social easing to improve predictive capability when extrapolating from real-time data. Results: Comparisons are given for the previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model and to the revised, what we call, SEIR Gaussian model. We also have developed an analogous model based on R0(t) that we call SEIR Statistical model to show the correspondence that can be attained. It is shown that these two models can replicate each other and therefore provide similar forecasts based on fitting to the same real-time data. We show the results for reported U.S. death rates up to June 12, 2020 at which time the cumulative death count was 113,820. The forecasted cumulative deaths for these two models and compared to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model are 140,440, 139,272, and 149,690 (for 8\/4\/20) and 147,819, 148, 912, and 201,129 (for 10\/1\/20), respectively. We also show how the SEIR asymmetric Gaussian model can also account for various scenarios of social distancing, social easing, and even rebound outbreaks where the death and case rates begin climbing again. Conclusions: Forecasting models, based on real-time data, are essential for guiding policy and human behavior to minimize the deadly impact of COVID-19 while balancing the need to socialize and energize the economy. It is becoming clear that changing social behavior from isolation to easing requires models that can adapt to the changing transmission rate in order to more accurately forecast death and case rates. We believe our asymmetric Gaussian approach has advantages over modified SEIR models in offering simpler governing equations that are dependent on fewer variables.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A.

We sought to develop a prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Data from the Ontario provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data. Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules > 0.92 ) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P > 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question. Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L.

The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focussed on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. We have studied the individual response to SARS-CoV-2 of asympromatic, mild and severe COVID-19 patients in order to investigate the role of innnate and adaptive immunity in determining the clinical course after first infection. Methods: To understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: (28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; 8 patients with mild COVID-19 disease and 8 cases of severe COVID-19 disease). Results: Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and rapidly declining antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. Conclusions: The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rita Carsetti","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Zaffina","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eva Piano Mortari","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Terreri","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Corrente","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claudia Capponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Palomba","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mattia Mirabella","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Simona Cascioli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palange","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Cuccaro","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Milito","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Camisa","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Vinci","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Annapaola Santoro","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Cimini","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Luisa Marchioni","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Nicastri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Palmieri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Ottavia Porzio","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlo Concato","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Onetti Muda","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Concetta Quintarelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabella Quinti","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Franco Locatelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137711","rel_title":"A Macroeconomic SIR Model for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137711","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have highlighted the close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic health. Macroeconomic models which use preexisting epidemic models to calculate the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic which explicitly considers herd immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control problem where the lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population - those who are low-risk (ages 20-64) and those who are high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases in mortality. Additionally, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses. Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erhan Bayraktar","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Asaf Cohen","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"April Nellis","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sara Terreri","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Corrente","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claudia Capponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Palomba","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mattia Mirabella","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Simona Cascioli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palange","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Cuccaro","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Milito","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Camisa","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Vinci","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Annapaola Santoro","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Cimini","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Luisa Marchioni","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Nicastri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Palmieri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Ottavia Porzio","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlo Concato","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Onetti Muda","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Concetta Quintarelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabella Quinti","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Franco Locatelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20137604","rel_title":"Universal scaling law for COVID-19 propagation in urban centers","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20137604","rel_abs":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a high demand for Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR) models to adjust and predict the number of cases in urban areas. Forecasting, however, is a difficult task, because the change in people's behavior reflects in a continuous change in the parameters of the model. An important question is what we can use from one city to another; if what happened in Madrid could have been applied to New York and then, if what we have learned from this city would be useful for Sao Paulo. To answer this question, we present an analysis of the transmission rate of COVID-19 as a function of population density and population size for US counties, cities of Brazil, German, and Portugal. Contrary to the common hypothesis in epidemics modeling, we observe a higher disease transmissibility for higher city's population density\/size --with the latter showing more predicting power. We present a contact rate scaling theory that explain the results, predicting that the basic reproductive number $R_0$ of epidemics scales as the logarithm of the city size.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben-Hur Francisco Cardoso","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"April Nellis","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sara Terreri","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Corrente","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Claudia Capponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Palomba","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mattia Mirabella","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Simona Cascioli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palange","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Cuccaro","author_inst":"Policlinico Umberto I Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Milito","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Camisa","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Rosaria Vinci","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Annapaola Santoro","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Cimini","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Luisa Marchioni","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Nicastri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Palmieri","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Chiara Agrati","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Ippolito","author_inst":"INMI L Spallanzani"},{"author_name":"Ottavia Porzio","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlo Concato","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Onetti Muda","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Raponi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Concetta Quintarelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"Isabella Quinti","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Franco Locatelli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Fung","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"John C Alverdy","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jessica Donington","author_inst":"University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20136960","rel_title":"Retrospective Methodology to Estimate Daily Infections from Deaths (REMEDID) in COVID-19: the Spain case study","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20136960","rel_abs":"The number of new daily infections is one of the main parameters to understand the dynamics of an epidemic.

The methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable infections were between 34 and 42 times more than the official ones on 14 March, when national government decreed the national lockdown. The latter had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately.
