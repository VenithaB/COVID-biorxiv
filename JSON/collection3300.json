There is a paucity of data on the impact of congestive heart failure (CHF) on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed\/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from 11\/1\/2019 till 06\/07\/2020, and identified all relevant studies reporting cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, disease severity, and survival. Pooled data from the selected studies were used for metanalysis to identify the impact of risk factors and cardiac biomarker elevation on disease severity and\/or mortality. Results: We collected pooled data on 5,967 COVID-19 patients from 20 individual studies. We found that both non-survivors and those with severe disease had an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmias, our pooled relative risk (RR) was - 8.52 (95% CI 3.63-19.98) (p<0.001); and 3.61 (95% CI 2.03-6.43) (p=0.001), respectively. Mean difference in the levels of Troponin-I, CK-MB, and NT-proBNP was higher in deceased and severely infected patients. The RR of in-hospital mortality was 2.35 (95% CI 1.18-4.70) (p=0.022) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.12-2.05) (p=0.008) among patients who had pre-existing CHF and hypertension, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 infection appears to significantly adversely impact patient prognosis and survival. Pre-existence of CHF and high cardiac biomarkers like NT-pro BNP and CK-MB levels in COVID-19 patients correlates with worse outcomes. Keywords: Acute cardiac injury; cardiac arrhythmia; mortality risk; cardiac biomarkers, COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarun Dalia","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Shubham Lahan","author_inst":"University College of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sagar Ranka","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Prakash Acharya","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Archana Gautam","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mastoris","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Andrew Sauer","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Zubair Shah","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20147934","rel_title":"Chest X-Ray Has Poor Diagnostic Accuracy and Prognostic Significance in COVID-19: A Propensity Matched Database Study","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20147934","rel_abs":"Objectives: To identify the diagnostic accuracy of common imaging modalities, chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the general emergency population in the UK and to find the association between imaging features and outcomes in these patients. Design: Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records Setting: Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants: 1,198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired RT-PCR swabs for SARS-CoV 2 and CXR between 16th March and 16th April 2020 Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. Odds ratios of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. For CT scans these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41-0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT compared with CXR, of 29% (95% CI 19%-38%, p<0.0001). Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. Chest X-ray findings were not statistically significantly or clinical meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions: Computed tomography has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Borakati","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Adrian Perera","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital, London, UK"},{"author_name":"James Johnson","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tara Sood","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospital, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Archana Gautam","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mastoris","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Andrew Sauer","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"},{"author_name":"Zubair Shah","author_inst":"University of Kansas Health System"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20140285","rel_title":"Estimating the establishment of local transmission and the cryptic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20140285","rel_abs":"We use a global metapopulation transmission model to study the establishment of sustained and undetected community transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.

It has been found that coronary artery disease (CAD) is a comorbid condition for COVID-19. As the risk factors of CAD, whether blood lipids levels are causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 is still unknown. Design: We performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to explore whether dyslipidemia, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were causally related to COVID-19 risk and severity. The GWAS summary data of blood lipids involving in 188,578 individuals and dyslipidemia in a total of 53,991 individuals were used as exposures, respectively. Two COVID-19 GWASs including 1,221 infected patients and 1,610 severe patients defined as respiratory failure were employed as outcomes. Based on the MR estimates, we further carried out gene-based and gene-set analysis to explain the potential mechanism for causal effect. Results: The MR results showed that dyslipidemia was casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19 and induced 27% higher odds for COVID-19 infection (MR-IVW OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.49, p-value = 3.18 x 10-3). Moreover, the increasing level of blood TC will raise 14 % higher odds for the susceptibility of COVID-19 (MR-IVW OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.25, p-value = 5.07 x 10-3). Gene-based analysis identified that ABO gene was associated with TC and the gene-set analysis found that immune processes were involved in the risk effect of TC. Conclusions: We obtained three conclusions: 1) Dyslipidemia is casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19; 2) TC is a risk factor for the susceptibility of COVID-19; 3) The different susceptibility of COVID-19 in specific blood group may be partly explained by the TC concentration in diverse ABO blood groups.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yan Guo","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhuo-Xin Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jing-Miao Ding","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Shi Yao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Dong-Lin Zhu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Honghui Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Huang","author_inst":"Honghui Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shan-Shan Dong","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Tie-Lin Yang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Fogarty International Center, NIH, USA"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA"},{"author_name":"M.

The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to qualitatively assess the testing capacity of a location; a high TPP could provide evidence that too few people are tested, leading to more under-reporting. In this study we propose a simple model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters in the model, related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. We use simulations to show situations in which the TPP is higher or lower than we expect based on these parameters, and the effect of testing strategies on the TPP. In our simulations, we find in the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between spatial locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. As a corollary, the TPP can be used to distinguish between a decline in confirmed cases due to decline in incidence (in which case TPP should decline) and a decline in confirmed cases due to testing constraints (in which case TPP should remain constant). We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms (test symptomatic proportion, TSP) encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. We suggest that collection of symptom status and age\/risk category of tested individuals can aid interpretation of changes in TPP and increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt D.T.

In the first scenario we assume that the parameters of the second wave in Illinois would be similar to those currently observed in other states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. We estimate doubling times of hospitalizations and test positivity in all states with relevant publicly available data and calculate the corresponding effective reproduction numbers for Illinois. These parameters are remarkably consistent in states with rapidly growing epidemics. We conjecture that the emergence of the second wave of the epidemic in these states can be attributed to superspreading events at large parties, crowded bars, and indoor dining. In our second, more optimistic scenario we assume changes in Illinois state policy would result in successful mitigation of superspreading events and thus would lower the effective reproduction number to the value observed in late June 2020. In this case our calculations show effective suppression of the second wave in Illinois. Our analysis also suggests that the logarithmic time derivatives of COVID-19 hospitalizations and case positivity can serve as a simple but strong early-warning signal of the onset of a second wave.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zach Weiner","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"George Wong","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Alexei Tkachenko","author_inst":"Brookhaven National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Derek A.T.

This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Wieland","author_inst":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Siyana Mahroof-Shaffi","author_inst":"Kitrinos Healthcare, Lesbos, Greece"},{"author_name":"Christian Harkensee","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Gateshead, Gateshead, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chamberlain","author_inst":"Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Derek A.T.

It has not affected all regions similarly, since the death rate can vary several folds between regions where the epidemic has remained at a low level and regions where it got an early burst. The epidemic has been slowed down by a lockdown that lasted for almost eight weeks, and individuals can now move between metropolitan French regions without restriction. In this report we investigate the effect on the epidemic of summer holidays, during which millions of individuals will move between French regions. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of strong or weak seasonality and of several values for the reproduction number on the epidemic, in particular on the timing, the height and the spread of a second wave. To do so, we extend a SEIR model to simulate the effect of summer migrations between regions on the number and distribution of new infections. We find that the model predicts little effect of summer migrations on the epidemic. However, all the reproduction numbers above 1.0 and the seasonality parameters we tried result in a second epidemic wave, with a peak date that can vary between October 2020 and April 2021. If the sanitary measures currently in place manage to keep the reproduction number below 1.0, the second wave will be avoided. If they keep the reproduction number at a low value, for instance at 1.1 as in one of our simulations, the second wave is flattened and could be similar to the first wave.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Duchemin","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Paris","author_inst":"IGFL, Institut de Genomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, Universite de Lyon, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, CNRS, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5242, 69364"},{"author_name":"Bastien Boussau","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chamberlain","author_inst":"Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Derek A.T.

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are greatly augmented if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. It is shown that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the level of lifting of lockdown was mild (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. Our study further shows that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Calistus N.

In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for surgical masks, as a recommendation to the general population, was investigated In order to determine the efficacy of the protective equipment we used a cough simulator that was carefully tuned to replicate human cough in terms of droplet size distribution and jet velocity. The protective equipment considered was placed on a manikin head that simulated human breathing. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) was used to analyze the concentration and size distribution of small particles that reached the manikin respiration pathways. Additionally, water sensitive papers were taped on the tested protective equipment and the manikin face, and subsequently photographed and analyzed. In the case of frontal exposure, for droplet diameter larger than 3m , the shield efficiency in blocking cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular surgical masks, with enhanced protection for portions of the face that the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, down to 0.3 micron diameter, a shield was found to perform even better, blocking about 10 times more fine particles than the surgical mask. When exposure from the side was considered, the performance of the shield was found to depend dramatically on its geometry. While a narrow shield allowed more droplets and aerosol to penetrate in comparison to a mask under the same configuration, a slightly wider shield significantly improved the performance. The ability of a shield worn by an infected person in order to protect others in his vicinity was also investigated. A shield, and alternatively, a surgical mask, were placed on the cough simulator, while the breathing simulator remained totally exposed. In both cases, no droplets or particles were found in the vicinity of the breathing simulator.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayala Ronen","author_inst":"Isreal Isntitute for Biological Research, Department of Environmental Physics"},{"author_name":"Hadar Rotter","author_inst":"Isreal Isntitute for Biological Research, Department of Physical Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Elisha","author_inst":"Isreal Isntitute for Biological Research, Department of Environmental Physics"},{"author_name":"Sagi Sevilia","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Department of Environmental Physics"},{"author_name":"Batya Parizer","author_inst":"Isreal Isntitute for Biological Research, Department of Environmental Physics"},{"author_name":"Nir Hafif","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Department of Physical Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Alon Manor","author_inst":"Israel Institute for Biological Research, Department of Environmental Physics"},{"author_name":"Kun Zhang","author_inst":"Honghui Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Huang","author_inst":"Honghui Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shan-Shan Dong","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Tie-Lin Yang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Kaiyuan Sun","author_inst":"Fogarty International Center, NIH, USA"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Xiong","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA"},{"author_name":"M.

Topics dominating news were not predominantly health-related, suggesting a limited presence of public health in news coverage in traditional and social media. Examples of misinformation were identified particularly in social media. Public health entities should utilize communication specialists to create engaging informational content to be shared on social media sites.

The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15 degrees N region and the Below 15 degrees S region during their summer months because the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15 degrees S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15 degrees S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15 degrees N region during these past months. Such preventative measures may allow the world to avoid the drastic lockdown policies and facilitate rapid global economic recovery from this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent Amanor-Boadu","author_inst":"Kansas State Universiy"},{"author_name":"Kara Ross","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Tendai Gwanzura","author_inst":"School of Community and Global Health, Claremont Graduate University"},{"author_name":"Nicole M.

From physiological and activity data, we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases. Failure to detect these changes in the remaining patients often occurred in those with chronic respiratory\/lung disease. Importantly the physiological alterations were detected prior to, or at, symptom onset in over 85% of the positive cases (21\/24), in some cases nine or more days before symptoms. Through daily surveys we can track physiological changes with symptom onset and severity. Finally, we develop a method to detect onset of COVID-19 infection in real-time which detects 67% of infection cases at or before symptom onset.

Antihistamines are safe and effective treatments for reducing inflammation and cytokine release. Combinations of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor antagonists have been effective in urticaria, and might reduce the histamine-mediated pulmonary cytokine storm in COVID-19. Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? Methods: A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. Results: Of all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine receptor blockade for at least 48 hours, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 hours of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited beneficial reductions in inpatient mortality and symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 inpatients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. Conclusions: This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm. Further clinical studies in COVID-19 are warranted of the repurposed off-label combination of two historically-safe histamine receptor blockers.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reed B Hogan II","author_inst":"GI Associates"},{"author_name":"Reed B Hogan III","author_inst":"GIAssociates"},{"author_name":"Tim Cannon","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates."},{"author_name":"Maria Rappi","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates"},{"author_name":"John Studdard","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates"},{"author_name":"Doug Paul","author_inst":"Medical Marketing Economics"},{"author_name":"Thomas P Dooley","author_inst":"Trends in Pharma Development LLC"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cordey","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Florian Laubscher","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Diem-Lan Vu","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Adrien Calame","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Manuel Schibler","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Frederique Jacquerioz","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Geraldine Blanchard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Didierlaurent","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"isabella eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Michael P Snyder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.27.20134932","rel_title":"Has the Indian lockdown averted deaths?","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.27.20134932","rel_abs":"Within the context of SEIR models, we consider a lockdown that is both imposed and lifted at an early stage of an epidemic. We show that, in these models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental models. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and the limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple epidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the Indian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suvrat Raju","author_inst":"International Centre for Theoretical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reed B Hogan III","author_inst":"GIAssociates"},{"author_name":"Tim Cannon","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates."},{"author_name":"Maria Rappi","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates"},{"author_name":"John Studdard","author_inst":"Jackson Pulmonary Associates"},{"author_name":"Doug Paul","author_inst":"Medical Marketing Economics"},{"author_name":"Thomas P Dooley","author_inst":"Trends in Pharma Development LLC"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cordey","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Florian Laubscher","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Diem-Lan Vu","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Adrien Calame","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Manuel Schibler","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Frederique Jacquerioz","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Geraldine Blanchard","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Claire-Anne Siegrist","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"University of Geneva Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Didierlaurent","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"isabella eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Michael P Snyder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.20142752","rel_title":"Mapping Systemic Inflammation and Antibody Responses in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.20142752","rel_abs":"Initially, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spared children from severe disease. However, after the initial wave of infections, clusters of a novel hyperinflammatory disease have been reported in regions with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. While the characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains unknown. Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases. We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal isotype-switching and neutralization capability. We further profiled the secreted immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, CCL28). Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Markers of activated myeloid function were also evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses. Finally, to assess the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti- IL6R antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization of inflammatory markers.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conor Gruber","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roosheel Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Trachman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lauren Lepow","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Karen M.

Therefore, we sought to classify counties in the United States across multiple domains utilizing a socioecological framework and examine the association between these county-level groups and Covid-19 mortality. We harmonized and linked county-level sociodemographic, health, and environmental metrics associated with increased susceptibility for Covid-19 mortality. Latent class analysis defined a county-level susceptibility index (CSI) based on these metrics (n=2701 counties). Next, we used linear regression models to estimate the associations of the CSI and Covid-19 deaths per capita and initial mortality doubling time (as of 6\/2\/20), adjusted for days since first Covid-19 case. We identified 4 groups classified by the CSI with distinct sociodemographic, health, and environmental profiles and widespread geographic dispersion. Covid-19 deaths per capita were significantly higher in the group consisting of rural, vulnerable counties (55.8 [95% CI 50.3-61.2] deaths per 100,000) compared with the group with diverse, urban counties (32.2 [27.3-37.0]) at similar points in the outbreak (76 days since first case). Our findings can inform equitable resource allocation for Covid-19 to allow targeted public health preparedness and response in vulnerable counties.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadiya Khan","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Megan McCabe","author_inst":"Northwestern"},{"author_name":"Amy Krefman","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lucia C.

To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid 19 deaths in both hospital and community settings. Aim: To document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy Design: A comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May. Setting: A crematorium in South Wales Participants: Individuals for whom an application was made for cremation. Main outcome measures: Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where infection acquired. Results: Of 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121\/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001). Conclusions: In a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated. Although men and women were represented in similar proportions, men were more likely to die in hospital. Over half the infections were acquired in either hospitals or nursing and residential homes with implications for the management of the pandemic, historically and in the future.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roland L.

The analysis was based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) using lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). The result confirms that by modifying public space configuration in this case by providing more space and increasing seating distance can reduce the vulnerability towards droplet dispersions. Whereas, providing shield including adding protection is far more effective in avoiding dispersions. The public space reconfiguration including increasing seat distance and reducing seating capacity also has an effect in reducing the indoor CO2. Capacity reduction from full capacity to 30% can decrease the CO2 from 5722 to 2144 ppm.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrio Adwibowo","author_inst":"University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Stephen P.

We hypothesized that the overall stringency of a government's interventions and the speed of implementation would affect the growth and level of deaths related to COVID-19 in that country. Design: Observational study based on an original database of global governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 170 countries from January 1, 2020 until May 27, 2020 by a team of researchers at Oxford University, UK. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0-100). Regression was used to show correlations between the speed and strength of government stringency and deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Interventions: Nine non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school and work closures, restrictions on international and domestic travel, public gathering bans, public information campaigns, as well as testing and contact tracing policies. Main outcomes measures: The primary outcome was deaths related to COVID-19, measured both in terms of maximum daily deaths and growth rate of daily deaths. Results: For each day of delay to reach an SI 40, the average daily growth rate in deaths was 0.087 percentage points higher (0.056 to 0.118, P<0.001). In turn, each additional point on the SI was associated with a 0.080 percentage point lower average daily growth rate (-0.121 to -0.039, P<.001). These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to SI 40 would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall. Conclusions: A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19.

This work quantifies the body of research related to the biological target of remdesivir, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or parent chemical structure, nucleoside analogs (NcAn), through 2019, as well as NIH funding for this research from 2000 to 2019. There were 6,567 RdRp related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and 11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million. Research Project grants accounted for 63% and 48% of Project Years for RdRp and NcAn respectively, but only 19% and 12% of Project Costs. Analytical modeling of research maturation estimates that RdRp and NcAn research passed an established maturity threshold in 2008 and 1994 respectively. Of 97 investigational compounds targeting RdRp since 1989, the three authorized for use entered clinical trials after both thresholds. This work demonstrates the scale of foundational research on the biological target and parent chemical structure of remdesivir that supported its discovery and development for COVID19. This work identifies $6.5 billion in NIH funding for research leading to remdesivir, underscoring the role of public sector investments in basic research and research infrastructure that underlie new drugs and the response to emergent disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekaterina Galkina Cleary","author_inst":"Center for Integration of Science and Industry, Bentley University, Waltham MA 02452"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify the causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed\/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'smell', and\/or 'olfaction'. We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID%[minus]19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss - subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli - to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mackenzie E Hannum","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Vicente A Ramirez","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah J Lipson","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Riley D Herriman","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Aurora K Toskala","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Cailu Lin","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Paule V Joseph","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Danielle R Reed","author_inst":"Monell Chemical Senses Center"},{"author_name":"Noam Angrist","author_inst":"Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tuballes","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manishkumar Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Mouskas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicole Simons","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Barcessat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Diane Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samantha Udondem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gurpawan Kang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Gangadharan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"George Ofori-Amanfo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Seunghee Kim-Schulze","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bruce Gelb","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144758","rel_title":"Comparison of two commercial platforms and a laboratory developed test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144758","rel_abs":"Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests, cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag(R) COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Mannonen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Hannimari Kallio-Kokko","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Anu Jaaskelainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Pia Jokela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Jenni Antikainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Paula Vare","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Eliisa Kekalainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Hanna Jarva","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Maija Lappalainen","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Mouskas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicole Simons","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Barcessat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Diane Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samantha Udondem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gurpawan Kang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Gangadharan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"George Ofori-Amanfo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Seunghee Kim-Schulze","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bruce Gelb","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.20146027","rel_title":"Sample Pooling as an efficient strategy for SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR screening: a multicenter study in Spain","rel_date":"2020-07-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.20146027","rel_abs":"Importance: The actual demand on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is a current challenge for clinical laboratories. Sample pooling may help to ameliorate workload in clinical laboratories. Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of sample pooling compared to the individual analysis for the diagnosis of CoVID-19, by using different commercial platforms for nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Design and settings: observational, prospective, multicentre study across 9 Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories including SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing performed in April 2020, during the first three days after acceptance to participate. Participants and Methods: 3519 naso-oro-pharyngeal samples received at the participating laboratories were processed individually and in pools (351 pools) according to the existing methodology in each of the centres. Results: We found that 253 pools (2519 samples) were negative, and 99 pools (990 samples) were positive; with 241 positive samples (6.85%), our pooling strategy would have saved 2167 PCR tests. For 29 pools (made out of 290 samples) we found discordant results when compared to their correspondent individual samples: in 24\/29 pools (30 samples), minor discordances were found; for five pools (5 samples), we found major discordances. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for pooling were 97.93%, 100%, 100% and 99.85% respectively; accuracy was 99.86% and kappa concordant coefficient was 0.988. As a result of the sample dilution effect of pooling, a loss of 2-3 Cts was observed for E, N or RdRP genes. Conclusion: we show a high efficiency of pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, across different RNA extraction and amplification platforms, with excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. We believe that our results may help clinical laboratories to respond to the actual demand and clinical need on SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for the screening of low prevalence populations.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adolfo de Salazar","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology Unit.
