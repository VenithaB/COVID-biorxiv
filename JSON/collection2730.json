Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium. Individuals presenting atypically, especially with anorexia, have higher mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark James Rawle","author_inst":"MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL & Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lee Bertfield","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Edward Brill","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"geriatric medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20148361","rel_title":"Artificial intelligence driven assessment of routinely collected healthcare data is an effective screening test for COVID-19 in patients presenting to hospital","rel_date":"2020-07-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20148361","rel_abs":"The early clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be difficult to distinguish from other undifferentiated medical presentations to hospital, however viral specific real- time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has limited sensitivity and can take up to 48 hours for operational reasons. In this study, we develop two early-detection models to identify COVID-19 using routinely collected data typically available within one hour (laboratory tests, blood gas and vital signs) during 115,394 emergency presentations and 72,310 admissions to hospital. Our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (AUROC 0.939) for COVID- 19 amongst all patients attending hospital, and Admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset admitted to hospital. Both models achieve high negative predictive values (>99%) across a range of prevalences (<5%), facilitating rapid exclusion during triage to guide infection control. We prospectively validated our models across all patients presenting and admitted to a large UK teaching hospital group in a two-week test period, achieving 92.3% (n= 3,326, NPV: 97.6%, AUROC: 0.881) and 92.5% accuracy (n=1,715, NPV: 97.7%, AUROC: 0.871) in comparison to RT-PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improves apparent accuracy (95.1% and 94.1%) and NPV (99.0% and 98.5%). Our artificial intelligence models perform effectively as a screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments and hospital admission units, offering high impact in settings where rapid testing is unavailable.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew AS Soltan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Kouchaki","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tingting Zhu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dani Kiyasseh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Taylor","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Dept.

Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases calls for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system. Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 11 COVID-19 patients. Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 2,600 samples derived from 11 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host.","rel_num_authors":54,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna C.

Numerous serologic antibody tests have become available through an expedited federal emergency use only process. This paper highlights the analytical characteristic of an ELISA based assay by AnshLabs and three random access immunoassay (RAIA) by DiaSorin, Roche, and Abbott that have been approved for emergency use authorization (EUA), at a tertiary academic center in a low disease-prevalence area. The AnshLabs gave higher estimates of sero-prevalence, over the three RAIA methods. For positive results, AnshLabs had 93.3% and 100% concordance with DiaSorin or Abbott and Roche respectively. For negative results, AnshLabs had 69.7% and 73.0% concordance with DiaSorin and Roche or Abbott respectively. All discrepant samples that were positive by AnshLabs and negative by RAIA tested positive by all-in-one step SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) assay performed on the automated Siemens Advia Centaur XPT analyzer. None of these methods, however, are useful in early diagnosis of SARSCoV- 2.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nguyen N Nguyen","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Manohar B Mutnal","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Richard R Gomez","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Huy N Pham","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Lam T Nguyen","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"William Koss","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Arundhati Rao","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Alejandro C Arroliga","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Dapeng Wang","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Yinan Hua","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Priscilla R Powell","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Colin McCormack","author_inst":"Baylor Scott & White"},{"author_name":"Walter J.

Malaysia is not spared from this pandemic as all universities were forced to close and initiate online learning with the implementation of Movement Control Order since mid-March 2020.The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning definitely deserves a reflection on how it affects the learning motivation among medical students. Hence, this is the first study that compares the effect of digital learning on learning motivation among medical students in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A modified Students Motivation towards Science Learning (SMTSL) was used to assess the learning motivation of UKM medical students throughout Year 1-5. The number of students that use digital learning during COVID-19 is significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 (p<0.05). However, there is no significant difference (p=0.872) in learning motivation among medical students before and during COVID-19 crisis. Higher frequency in digital learning usage frequency does not exert a great impact on learning motivation. Reflections from each participant were collated to justify the current situation. This could be due to motivation coming from the very choice to pursue medicine as a doctor, which is mainly influenced by intrinsic motivation, and ability to adapt in difficult situations. Thus, medical educators should be creative in enhancing extrinsic motivation by making use of digital learning as a platform so that medical students are able to independently fish for information in the vast pool of digital information and apply in actual medical practice in the future for life-long learning.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noor A.S.

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. Findings: The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ([&le;] 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([&ge;] 130 mg\/L), blood urea nitrogen ([&ge;] 18 mg\/dL), and blood creatinine ([&ge;] 1.2 mg\/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io\/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. Interpretation: The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Galit Lukin","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Mingardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omid Nohadani","author_inst":"Benefits Science Technologies"},{"author_name":"Agni Orfanoudaki","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Stellato","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Holly Wiberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sara Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, CSIC, University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Carlos Luis Parra-Calderon","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, CSIC, University of Seville"},{"author_name":"- The Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth Robinson","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Michelle Schneider","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Barry Stein","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Alberto Estirado","author_inst":"HM Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lia a Beccara","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Rosario Canino","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Martina Dal Bello","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Federica Pezzetti","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

It has also been suggested that the D614G variant found more commonly in the US and across European countries may explain why PIMS-TS appears to be common in these countries. Here we analysed viral sequences from 13 paediatric COVID-19 patients of whom five were diagnosed with PIMS-TS. This is the first characterisation of viruses from PIMS-TS patients.

In vitro, studies indicated that ivermectin (IVM) has antiviral effect. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg \/kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+\/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+\/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+\/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+\/-}2.75 versus 13.22 {+\/-}.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82). No adverse events were observed Conclusions : Add-on use of IVM to HCQ and AZT had better effectiveness, shorter hospital stay, and relatively safe compared with controls. however, a larger prospective study with longer follow up may be needed to validate these results.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Faiq I.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 as new cause of severe viral pneumonia (CoVID-19) reaching Europe by late January 2020. We validated the WHO-recommended assay and describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs). Methods. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 individuals were prospectively tested by the Basel-S-gene and the WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 together with SARS-CoV-2. Results. Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) positive samples. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 NOPS. Adults were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while children were more likely to test CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced other CARVs within 3 weeks reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhino\/enterovirus (13%), influenzavirus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial (6%) and metapneumovirus (6%). Conclusions. The differential diagnosis for respiratory infections was broad during the early pandemic, affecting infection control and treatment decisions. We discuss the role of pre-existing immunity and competitive CARV replication for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults and children.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karoline Leuzinger","author_inst":"University of Basel and University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Rainer Gosert","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Kirstine Soegaard","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Klaudia Naegele","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Anna Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Vladimira Hinic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100\/101) and 96.04% (97\/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60\/68) and 97.06% (66\/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67\/68). Conclusion: Combined detection of serum SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies had better sensitivity compared with single IgM or IgG test, which can be used as an important diagnostic tool for SARS-COV-2 infection and a screening tool of potential SARS-COV-2 carriers in clinics, hospitals and accredited scientific laboratory.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fang Hu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Shang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Meizhou Chen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Changliang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huangshi Central Hospital, Edong Healthcare Group (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Klaudia Naegele","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Anna Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Vladimira Hinic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

We developed highly sensitive CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralization assays. CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n=87) and were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which was also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Further, subjects who donated plasma further out from the diagnosis of COVID-19 appeared to have lower titers. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also contained NAbs against SARS Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mikail Dogan","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lina Kozhaya","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Placek","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Courtney Gunter","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Mesut Yigit","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rachel Hardy","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Matt Plassmeyer","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Paige Coatney","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Kimberleigh Lillard","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"Suny Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinberg","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Hayes","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Moshe Arditi","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. 'flattens the curve'), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden. In conclusion, we present a novel approach to evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity, to achieve public health goals for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jody R Reimer","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Sharia M Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Brintz","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Rashmee U Shah","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Ferrari","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T Leung","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Paige Coatney","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Kimberleigh Lillard","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"Suny Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinberg","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Hayes","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Moshe Arditi","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

Here we quantify the impact of 4,579 NPIs implemented in 76 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We use a hierarchically coded data set of NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques, which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs strongly varies across countries and world regions, and in relation to human and economic development as well as different dimensions of governance. We quantify the effectiveness of each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption, i.e., how early into the epidemics. The emerging picture is one in which no one-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI alone can decrease Rt below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns that are also highly effective, such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system. By allowing to simulate ``what-if'' scenarios at the country level, our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nils Haug","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Lukas Geyrhofer","author_inst":"Complexity Science Hub Vienna"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Londei","author_inst":"Sony Computer Science Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Elma Dervic","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Amelie Desvars-Larrive","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Vittorio Loreto","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Beate Pinior","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna"},{"author_name":"Stefan Thurner","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Peter Klimek","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Zaheer Bukhari","author_inst":"Suny Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Kleinberg","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Hayes","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Moshe Arditi","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. As of the 7th June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13% (95% CrI: 5.6% - 24%) (Belgium). Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nick Golding","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute and Curtin University"},{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Wright","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory\/Sopra Steria, Fareham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamish Gibbs","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John W Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.\n\nMethodsAn extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with {+\/-}1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37\/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https:\/\/www.internationalgenome.org\/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http:\/\/pngu.mgh.harvard.edu\/purcell\/plink\/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https:\/\/genemania.org\/).\n\nResultsA total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and\/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leire Moya","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Farashi","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology and Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Suravajhala","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Panchadsaram Janaththani","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology and Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jyotsna Batra","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology, Translational Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamish Gibbs","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John W Edmunds","author_inst":"Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ellen Klapper","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Noah Merin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruce T Liang","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Raavi Gupta","author_inst":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oral Alpan","author_inst":"Amerimmune"},{"author_name":"Derya Unutmaz","author_inst":"Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis.

The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonny R.

One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapeutic development.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Chen","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Brandon Malone","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Llewellyn","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Michael Grasso","author_inst":"The Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Patrick M.M.

We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Melero","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Oscar S Sorzano","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Brent Foster","author_inst":"Dept. of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Vilas","author_inst":"Dept. of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Martinez","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Roberto Marabini","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Erney Ramirez-Aportela","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ruben Sanchez-Garcia","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"David Herreros","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laura del Cano","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Patricia Losana","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia-CSIC, C\/ Darwin, 3, 28049, Cantoblanco, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Yunior C.

There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Sun","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pan Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Ju","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jian Rao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wenze Huang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Shaojun Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Tuanlin Xiong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Kui Xu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Zhou","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wrapp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA"},{"author_name":"Pablo Chacon","author_inst":"Instituto Rocasolano-CSIC, c\/Serrano, 119, 28006, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jason S.

The virus effects individuals quite differently, with many infected patients showing only mild symptoms, and others showing critical illness. To lessen the impact of the pandemic, one important question is which factors predict the death of a patient? Here, we construct an enhanced COVID-19 dataset by processing two existing databases (from Kaggle and WHO) and using natural language processing methods to enhance the data by adding local weather conditions and research sentiment.Author summary In this study, we contribute an enhanced COVID-19 dataset, which contains 183 samples and 43 features. Application of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on the enhanced dataset achieves 95% accuracy in predicting patients survival, with country-wise research sentiment, and then age and local weather, showing the most importance.

Among people aged [&ge;]18 years enrolled in the health plan for at least 4 months as of 2\/29\/2020, current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications.

All but one of the newly characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessia Lai","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Annalisa Bergna","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Sara Caucci","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy."},{"author_name":"Nicola Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Ilaria Vicenti","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Filippo Dragoni","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Padova, Padua, Italy."},{"author_name":"Stefano Menzo","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, ASST Cremona, Cremona (MI), Italy."},{"author_name":"Annapaola Callegaro","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adriano Tagliabracci","author_inst":"Section of Legal Medicine, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Caruso","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ronchiadin","author_inst":"Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, AI LAB, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Maurizio Zazzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

A multi-omic approach was adopted, and in the discovery phase, global proteome\/metaproteome\/metabolome were analysed in the respiratory specimens of SARS-CoV-2 positive [n=20], negative [n=20], and H1N1 positive [n=5] cases. We identified MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1) and WARS (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase) as clues to viral diagnosis and validated in 200 SARS-CoV-2 suspects. MX1 >30pg\/ml and WARS >25ng\/ml segregated virus positives patients [(AUC=94%CI(0.91-0.97)]. Distinct increase in SARS-CoV-2 induced immune activation, metabolic reprograming and a decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing, fluid regulation, vitamin and steroid metabolism was seen (p<0.05). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viraemia and segregated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the multiomics approach identified increased respiratory pathogens [Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia] and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05, p<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens. Conclusion: Novel proteins [MX1 and WARS] can rapidly and reliably diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify asymptomatic and mild disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaswinder Singh Maras","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shvetank Sharma","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Adil Rafiq Bhat","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Reshu Aggarwal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ekta Gupta","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiv K Sarin","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Padova, Padua, Italy."},{"author_name":"Stefano Menzo","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, Virology Unit, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, ASST Cremona, Cremona (MI), Italy."},{"author_name":"Annapaola Callegaro","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adriano Tagliabracci","author_inst":"Section of Legal Medicine, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Arnaldo Caruso","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ronchiadin","author_inst":"Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, AI LAB, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Balotta","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Maurizio Zazzi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy."},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Design: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given. Setting: England. Participants: 34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors. Results: The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In 133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms, stably over time. Conclusion: The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koen B Pouwels","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas House","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Julie V Robotham","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Paul Birrell","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Gelman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Nikola Bowers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Boreham","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Heledd Thomas","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"James Lewis","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Iain Bell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lior Rennert","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Corey Andrew Kalbaugh","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Lu Shi","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Christopher McMahan","author_inst":"Clemson University"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Gelman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Nikola Bowers","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Ian Boreham","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Heledd Thomas","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"James Lewis","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Iain Bell","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[&ge;]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[&ge;]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Xie","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sichun Chen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xueli Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Central China Development, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Baige Li","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tianlu Zhang","author_inst":"zhangtianlu99@163.com"},{"author_name":"Xingwei He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"NingLing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Hypertension at Heart Center, People's Hospital, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luyan Wang","author_inst":"Heart Center, Peking University Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Eye Center, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.

Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the projected and actual numbers as well as population proportions of COVID-19 cases in the 46 sub-Saharan African countries on May 1st, May 29th (4 weeks later) and June 26th (8 weeks later). The source of the projected number of cases was a publication by scientists from the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whereas the actual number of cases was obtained from the WHO situation reports. We calculated the percentage difference between the projected and actual numbers of cases per country. Further, N-1 chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the projected and actual population proportion of COVID-19 cases, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference between these population proportions. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with 0.05 used as threshold for statistical significance. Results. On May 1st, May 29th and June 26th, respectively 40 (86.95%), 45 (97.82%) and 41 (89.13%) of the sub-Saharan African countries reported a number of confirmed cases that was lower than the predicted number of 1000 cases for May 1st and 10000 for both May 29th and June 26th. At these dates, the population proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases were significantly lower (p-value <0.05) than the projected proportions of cases. Across all these dates, South-Africa always exceeded the predicted number and population proportion of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion. Sub-Saharan African countries did defy the dire predictions of the COVID-19 burden. Preventive measures should be further enforced to preserve this positive outcome.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fokoua Maxime Christophe Dongmo","author_inst":"University of New York State - University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amor Ndjabo Monique","author_inst":"School of Health Sciences, Catholic University of Central Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Ankobil Amandus","author_inst":"University of New York State - University at Albany School of Public Health, Albany, USA"},{"author_name":"Kiyung Victor Momah","author_inst":"School of Health Sciences, Catholic University of Central Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Metomb Franck Steve","author_inst":"Regional Delegation of Public Health for the Center Region, Ministry of Public Health, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Choukem Simeon Pierre","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine and Specialties, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"NingLing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Hypertension at Heart Center, People's Hospital, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Luyan Wang","author_inst":"Heart Center, Peking University Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Eye Center, Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"John I Bell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Newton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Farrar","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust"},{"author_name":"Ian Diamond","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Pete Benton","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Sarah Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Vaccher","author_inst":"Medical Oncology and Immune-related Tumors, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano 33081, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Clementi","author_inst":"Microbiology and Virology Unit, \"Vita-Salute\" San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Gianguglielmo Zehender","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences Luigi Sacco, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Dennis Hartigan-OConnor","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Stephen J.
