Different age-groups are also impacted differently. However, it remains unclear whether the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and hospitalization or the length of stay in the hospital is different for different age groups, gender, residence place or whether it is time dependent. Methods Sciensano, the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health, collected information on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 hospital admissions from 114 participating hospitals in Belgium. Between March 14, 2020 and June 12, 2020, a total of 14,618 COVID-19 patients were registered. The time of symptom onset, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, time of hospitalization, time of recovery or death, and length of stay in intensive care are recorded. The distributions of these different event times for different age groups are estimated accounting for interval censoring and right truncation in the observed data. Results The truncated and interval-censored Weibull regression model is the best model for the time between symptom onset and diagnosis\/hospitalization best, whereas the length of stay in hospital is best described by a truncated and interval-censored lognormal regression model. Conclusions The time between symptom onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and diagnosis are very similar, with median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days, depending on the age of the patient and whether or not the patient lives in a nursing home. Patients coming from a nursing home facility have a slightly prolonged time between symptom onset and hospitalization (i.e., 2 days). The longest delay time is observed in the age group 20-60 years old. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis follows the same trend, but on average is one day longer as compared to the time to hospitalization. The median length of stay in hospital varies between 3 and 10.4 days, with the length of stay increasing with age. However, a difference is observed between patients that recover and patients that die. While the hospital length of stay for patients that recover increases with age, we observe the longest time between hospitalization and death in the age group 20-60. And, while the hospital length of stay for patients that recover is shorter for patients living in a nursing home, the time from hospitalization to death is longer for these patients. But, over the course of the first wave, the length of stay has decreased, with a decrease in median length of stay of around 2 days.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Data Science Institute (DSI), I-BioStat, Hasselt University"},{"author_name":"Steven Abrams","author_inst":"Data Science Institute (DSI), I-BioStat, Hasselt University & Global Health Institute (GHI), University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Dominique Van Beckhoven","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and public health, Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Geert Meyfroidt","author_inst":"Department and Laboratory of Intensive Care Medicine, UniversityHospitals Leuven and KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Erika Vlieghe","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Infectious and TropicalDiseases, University Hospital Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Data Science Institute (DSI), I-BioStat, Universiteit Hasselt & Centre for Health Economics Research and Modelling of InfectiousDiseases (CHERMID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20156778","rel_title":"COVID-19 DEATH TOLL: THE ROLE OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20156778","rel_abs":"Background: Several months into the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a limited understanding of the underlying country-specific factors associated with COVID-19 spread and mortality. This study aims to investigate the role of nations' economic development in the death toll associated with COVID-19 in Europe and Israel. Methods: Number of COVID-19 cases, deaths per million, and case fatality rate (CFR) in Israel and 39 countries in Europe were described across quintiles of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The association between GDP per capita and COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and CFR was investigated using generalized linear modeling adjusting for the proportion of elderly and density of the population. Results: In countries belonging to the three lower GDP quintiles, COVID-19 incidence rates per million (range 708-1134) were substantially lower compared to countries in the fourth (3939) and fifth (3476) quintiles. Major differences were also calculated in COVID-19 mortality rates per million (25-31 vs. 222-268). There was no significant (p=0.19) differences in CFR between GDP quintiles (range: 2.79-7.62%). Conclusions: COVID-19 had a greater toll in more developed nations. Though comparisons are limited by differences in testing, reporting and lockdown policies, this association likely reflects increased spread from trade and tourism in wealthier countries, whereas limited health system capacity and lack of treatment and vaccination options contributed to higher than expected CFR in wealthier countries. This unique situation will probably encourage the stronger economies to invest the required financial capacity to respond to and recover from the current crisis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Chodcik","author_inst":"Maccabitech"},{"author_name":"Clara Weil","author_inst":"Maccabi Healthcare Services"},{"author_name":"Dominique Van Beckhoven","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and public health, Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Geert Meyfroidt","author_inst":"Department and Laboratory of Intensive Care Medicine, UniversityHospitals Leuven and KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Erika Vlieghe","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Infectious and TropicalDiseases, University Hospital Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Data Science Institute (DSI), I-BioStat, Universiteit Hasselt & Centre for Health Economics Research and Modelling of InfectiousDiseases (CHERMID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20156992","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada, January 1-July 6, 2020","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20156992","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada.

However, little is known regarding the systematic review of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. The current study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS CoV 2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID 19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. Methods: We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Results: Fourteen studies of 2,568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.44 days (95% CI: 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to recurrent positive result was 9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age (mean difference [MD]=-2.27, 95% CI: -2.95 to -1.80) and a longer initial illness (MD=8.24 days; 95% CI: 7.54-8.95; I2=98.9%) were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes (RR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; I2=53%), severe disease (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; I2=70%), and a low lymphocyte count (RR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.86; I2=48%) were less likely to experience recurrent SARS CoV 2 positivity. Conclusions: The incidence of recurrent SARS CoV 2 positivity was 14.81%. The estimated interval from disease onset to repeat positivity was 35.44 days, and the estimated interval from the last negative result to recurrent positive result duration was 9.76 days.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahalul Azam","author_inst":"Universitas Negeri Semarang"},{"author_name":"Rina Sulistana","author_inst":"Universitas Negeri Semarang"},{"author_name":"Martha Ratnawati","author_inst":"SMC Tlogorejo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arulita Ika Fibriana","author_inst":"Universitas Negeri Semarang"},{"author_name":"Udin Bahrudin","author_inst":"Diponegoro University"},{"author_name":"Syed Mohamed Aljunid","author_inst":"Kuwait University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.19.20157248","rel_title":"Disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.19.20157248","rel_abs":"Background. Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each state and union territory (UT) of India has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state and union territory governments. This assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting by other governments. Methods. We designed a semi-quantitative framework to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the states and union territories of India. This framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We then used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0 to 1) for 29 states based on the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state during the two-week period from 19 May to 1 June, 2020. States that reported less than 10 total confirmed cases as of May 18 were excluded from the study. Findings. Our results indicate a strong disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state governments in India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Only ten states provide a visual representation of the trend in COVID-19 data. Ten states do not report any data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by releasing their personally identifiable information on the official websites. Across the states, the CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630, p=0.0003). Interpretation. The disparity in CDRS across states highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states in India. Coordination among states is particularly important as more people start moving across states in the coming months. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence. Funding.

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults ([&ge;]18 years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were given treatment. Treatment included hydroxycholoroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Corticosteroids were included as adjunctive therapy in mid-April, 2020. We compared composite outcomes of clinical progression and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or death between group that received treatment only (Group A) versus group that received adjunctive corticosteroids (Group B). Entropy balancing was used to generate stabilized weight for covariates between treatment groups. Unweighted Kaplan-Meir curves, weighted and adjusted Cox regression analysis were used to estimate effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on composite outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed on those with pneumonia. Results: Of 1046 patients with COVID-19, 57 received treatment alone (Group A) and 35 received adjunctive corticosteroids in addition to treatment (Group B). Median day of illness at treatment initiation was 5 day. There were 44 patients with pneumonia; 68.9% of them were not requiring supplemental oxygen at treatment initiation. Overall, 17 (18.5%) of 92 patients had clinical progression including 13 (22.8%) of 57 patients in Group A versus 4 (11.4%) of 35 patients in Group B (p=0.172). Unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no significant difference in the proportion of patients who had clinical progression or invasive MV or death between the 2 treatment groups. However in those with pneumonia, there were lower proportions of patients in Group B with clinical progression (11.1% , 95% CI 0.0 - 22.2 versus 58.8%, 95% CI 27.3 - 76.7, log rank p<0.001 ); and invasive MV or death (11.3%, 95% CI 0.0 - 22.5 versus 41.2%, 95% CI 12.4. - 60.5, log rank p=0.016). In weighted and adjusted cox regression analysis, patients in Group B were less likely to have clinical progression, (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.99, p=0.049) but there was no statistical significant difference in risk of requiring invasive MV or death (aHR 0.22, 95%CI 0.02 - 2.54, p=0.22). In subgroup with pneumonia, patients in Group B were significantly at lower risk of clinical progression (aHR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.39, p<0.001) and requiring invasive MV compared to Group A (aHR 0.30, 0.10-0.87, p=0.029). Conclusions: Use of adjunctive corticosteroids is associated with lower risk of clinical progression and invasive MV or death, especially in those with pneumonia. Concurrent use of antivirals and corticosteroids should be considered in the management of COVID-19 related pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Say Tat Ooi","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Purnima Parthasarathy","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yi Lin","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Valliammai Nallakaruppan","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Shereen Ng","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Teck Choon Tan","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Serena Low","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Terence Tang","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat hospital, Singapore"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155168","rel_title":"Preliminary optimisation of a simplified sample preparation method to permit direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 within saliva samples using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155168","rel_abs":"We describe the optimization of a simplified sample preparation method which permits rapid and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within saliva using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Treatment of saliva samples prior to RT-LAMP by dilution 1:1 in MucolyseTM, followed by dilution (within the range of 1 in 5 to 1 in 40) in 10% (w\/v) Chelex 100 Resin and a 98oC heat step for 2 minutes enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all positive saliva samples tested, with no amplification detected in pooled negative saliva. The time to positivity for which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in these positive saliva samples was proportional to the real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR cycle threshold (CT), with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in as little as 05:43 (CT 21.08), 07:59 (CT 24.47) and 08:35 (CT 25.27) minutes, respectively. The highest CT where direct RT-LAMP detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 31.39 corresponding to a 1 in 40 dilution of a positive saliva sample (1:1 in MucolyseTM) with a starting CT of 25.27. When RT-LAMP was performed on pools of SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva samples spiked with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, RNA was detected at dilutions spanning 1 in 5 to 1 in 160 representing CTs spanning 22.49-26.43. Here we describe a simple but critical rapid sample preparation method which can be used up front of RT-LAMP to permit direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 within saliva samples. Saliva is a sample which can be collected non-invasively without the use of highly skilled staff and critically can be obtained from both healthcare and home settings. Critically, this approach overcomes both the requirement and validation of different swabs and the global bottleneck in obtaining RNA extraction robots and reagents to enable molecular testing by PCR. Such testing opens the possibility of public health approaches for effective intervention to control the COVID-19 pandemic through regular SARS-CoV-2 testing at a population scale, combined with isolation and contact tracing for positive cases.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Howson","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jason Sawyer","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Claire Cassar","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"David Cross","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Tom Lewis","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Jessica Hockey","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Samantha Rivers","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Saira Cawthraw","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Ashley Banyard","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Paul Anderson","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Sabah Rahou","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clarke","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20156810","rel_title":"Neutralizing and binding antibody kinetics of COVID-19 patients during hospital and convalescent phases","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20156810","rel_abs":"Knowledge of the host immune response after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for informing directions of vaccination and epidemiological control strategies against COVID-19. In this study, thirty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 244 serial blood specimens (38.1% after hospital discharge) collected to explore the chronological evolution of neutralizing (NAb), total (TAb), IgM, IgG and IgA antibody in parallel. IgG titers reached a peak later (approximately 35 days postonset) than those of Nab, Ab, IgM and IgA (20~25 days postonset). After peaking, IgM levels declined with an estimated average half-life of 10.36 days, which was more rapid than those of IgA (51.25 days) and IgG (177.39 days). Based on these half-life data, we estimate that the median times for IgM, IgA and IgG to become seronegative are 4.59 (IQR 4.12-5.03), 7.78 (IQR 6.71-9.16) and 42.72 (IQR 33.75-47.96) months post disease onset. The relative contribution of IgM to NAb was higher than that of IgG (standardized {beta} regression coefficient: 0.53 vs 0.48), so the rapid decline in NAb may be attributed to the rapid decay of IgM in acute phase. However, the relative contribution of IgG to NAb increased and that of IgM further decreased after 6 weeks postonset. It's assumed that the decline rate of NAb might slow down to the same level as that of IgG over time. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses in patients and that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquired by infection may persist for a relatively long time.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang-Yang Yao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yong Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Hua-Long Xiong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Ying Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Tingdong Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Shi-Yin Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Xue-Jie Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Feng Bi","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Chen-Xi Deng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Cai-Yu Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Tian-Ying Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhan-Xiang Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-xiang Ge","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Xia Ningshao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20156851","rel_title":"Transparency Assessment of COVID-19 Models","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20156851","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major societal unrest, modelers have worked to project future trends of COVID-19 and predict upcoming challenges and impacts of policy action.

We evaluated 29 COVID-19 models receiving high attention levels within the scientific community and\/or informing government responses. We evaluated these models against 27 transparency criteria. We found high levels of transparency in model documentation aspects such as reporting uncertainty analysis; however, about half of the models do not share code and a quarter do not report equations.

We hypothesised that reductions would vary by patient age and disease type. We examined pre- and in-lockdown ED attendances for two COVID-19 unrelated diagnoses; one likely to be affected by lockdown measures (gastroenteritis) and one likely to be unaffected (appendicitis). Methods Retrospective cross-sectional study conducted across two EDs in one London hospital Trust. We compared all adult and paediatric ED attendances, before (January 2020) and during lockdown (March\/April 2020). Key patient demographics, method of arrival and discharge location were compared. We used SNOMED codes to define attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. Results ED attendances fell from 1129 per day before lockdown to 584 in-lockdown; 51.7% of pre-lockdown rates. In-lockdown attendances were lowest for under-18s (16.0% of pre-lockdown). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital increased from 17.3% to 24.0% and the proportion admitted to intensive care increased four-fold. Attendances for gastroenteritis fell from 511 to 103; 20.2% of pre-lockdown rates. Attendances for appendicitis also decreased, from 144 to 41; 28.5% of pre-lockdown rates. Conclusion ED attendances fell substantially following lockdown implementation. The biggest reduction was for under-18s. We observed reductions in attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. This may reflect lower rates of infectious disease transmission, though the fall in appendicitis-related attendances suggests that behavioural factors are also important. Larger studies are urgently needed to understand changing patterns of ED use and access to emergency care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate Honeyford","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Charles Coughlan","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Paul Expert","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Burcea","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Anne Kinderlerer","author_inst":"Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham S Cooke","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Ceire S Costelloe","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Feng Bi","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Chen-Xi Deng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Cai-Yu Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Tian-Ying Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhan-Xiang Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-xiang Ge","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Xia Ningshao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157602","rel_title":"The COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan, China: epidemiology and impact of interventions","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157602","rel_abs":"In January 2020, a COVID19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China.

The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. Severity of symptoms increased with age. We estimated R0 at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6-3.7).

These factors may in turn impact upon sleep health. Research on sleep deprivation during the pandemic crisis to date has been limited. The present study aimed to explore the levels and social determinants of self-reported sleep loss among the general population during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, with a particular focus on ethnic and gender disparities. Methods: Newly available national representative survey data from Understanding Society COVID19 Study collected during April 2020 were analysed. These data were linked to Wave 9 of Understanding Society conducted in 2018\/19, providing information about the respondents prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Cross-sectional analysis provided prevalence estimates, whilst analysis of the linked longitudinal data provided incidence estimates. The analytical sample included 15,360 respondents aged 16 and above; among these, 12,206 reported no problem of sleep loss before the epidemic. Results: Prevalence and incidence rates of perceived sleep loss were 24.7% and 20.2% respectively. Women (at the level of 31.8% and 27.0%) and individuals from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities (at the level of 32.0% and 24.6%) were more vulnerable to sleep deprivation due to the pandemic. Multivariate regression analysis shows that being female, the presence of young children in the household, perceived financial difficulties and being a Covid-19-related key worker were all predictive of sleep loss. Once these covariates were controlled for the bivariate relationship between ethnicity and sleep loss was reversed, reflecting the complex interaction between the coronavirus epidemic and ethnicity. Conclusions: The pandemic has widened the disparity of sleep deprivation across different groups, with women with young children, key workers and people of BAME heritage all experiencing difficulty in sleeping, which in turn may negatively affect mental and physical health and well-being.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jane Falkingham","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Maria Evandrou","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Min Qin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Athina Vlachantoni","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Xiaohan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Engineering and Computer Science, New York University Shanghai, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio-technical Systems, Northeastern University, Boston, MA USA"},{"author_name":"Jiancheng Lv","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhou","author_inst":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Indiana University Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Tian-Ying Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhan-Xiang Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-xiang Ge","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Xia Ningshao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20155960","rel_title":"Observational Study of the Efficiency of Treatments in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 in Madrid","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20155960","rel_abs":"Background Many different treatments were heavily administered to patients with COVID-19 during the peak of the pandemic in Madrid without robust evidence supporting them. Methods We examined the association between sixteen treatments in four groups (steroids, antivirals, antibiotics and immunomodulators) and intubation or death. Data were obtained from patients that were admitted to an HM hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 until 24\/04\/2020, excluding unconfirmed diagnosis, those who were admitted before the epidemic started in Madrid, had an outcome that was not discharge or death or died within 24 hours of presentation. We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16%) died and 311 (18.9%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In this multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and prednisone administration was found to be associated with improved outcomes. Other treatments were associated with no effect or worse outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikolas Bernaola","author_inst":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Raquel Mena","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ander Bernaola","author_inst":"Universidad Francisco de Vitoria"},{"author_name":"Antonio Lara","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario la Zarzuela"},{"author_name":"Cesar Carballo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Pedro Larranaga","author_inst":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Concha Bielza","author_inst":"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jiancheng Lv","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety, Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhou","author_inst":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Indiana University Bloomington, IN, USA"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Tian-Ying Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Zhan-Xiang Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-xiang Ge","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Xia Ningshao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases, Strai"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.211623","rel_title":"Integrative Vectors for Regulated Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Implicated in RNA Metabolism","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.211623","rel_abs":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to result in substantial reorganization of host cell RNA metabolism. We identified 14 proteins that were predicted to interact with host RNAs or RNA binding proteins, based on published data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a series of affinity-tagged and codon-optimized expression constructs for each of these 14 proteins. Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His8, the C-terminus with His8-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the HEK293 Flp-In TREx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins and quantified by western blot.

IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBCs. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 in convalescent subjects were higher than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.\n\nIMPORTANCERecent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key questions are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre- and post-infection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phuong Nguyen-Contant","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Abdul Karim Embong","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Preshetha Kanagaiah","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Francisco Chaves","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Hongmei Yang","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Angela Ramona Branche","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David J.

In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-{kappa}B and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-{kappa}B response is mediated by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-{kappa}B driven inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to suppress severe disease symptoms.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher J Neufeldt","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Berati Cerikan","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Frankish","author_inst":"BioMed X"},{"author_name":"Ji-Young Lee","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka Plociennikowska","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Florian Heigwer","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Joecks","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Sandy S Burkart","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"David Y Zander","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Gendarme","author_inst":"BioMed X"},{"author_name":"Bachir El Debs","author_inst":"BioMed X"},{"author_name":"Niels Halama","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Uta Merle","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Michael Boutros","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Marco Binder","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Ralf Bartenschlager","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.213249","rel_title":"Evaluation of a novel multiplexed assay for determining IgG levels and functional activity to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.213249","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of new serological assays that could aid in diagnosis and evaluation of seroprevalence to inform an understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease.

Understanding antibody dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection is therefore crucial. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is also vital for large seroprevalence surveys which inform government policies and public health interventions. However, rapidly waning antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection could jeopardize the sensitivity of serological testing on which these surveys depend. Methods: This prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics in a central London hospital analyzed 137 serial samples collected from 67 participants seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 by the Meso-Scale Discovery assay. Antibody titers were quantified to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), spike (S-)protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Titers were log-transformed and a multivariate log-linear model with time-since-infection and clinical variables was fitted by Bayesian methods. Results: The mean estimated half-life of the N-antibody was 52 days (95% CI 42-65). The S- and RBD-antibody had significantly longer mean half-lives of 81 days (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI 55-137) respectively. An ACE-2-receptor competition assay demonstrated significant correlation between the S and RBD-antibody titers and ACE2-receptor blocking in-vitro. The time-to-a-negative N-antibody test for 50% of the seropositive population was predicted to be 195 days (95% CI 163-236). Discussion: After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the predicted half-life of N-antibody was 52 days with 50% of seropositive participants becoming seronegative to this antibody at 195 days. Widely used serological tests that depend on the N-antibody will therefore significantly underestimate the prevalence of infection following the majority of infections.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Grandjean","author_inst":"University College London, Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Anja Saso","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arturo Ortiz","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Tanya Lam","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"James Hatcher","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rosie Thistlethwaite","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark Harris","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Timothy Best","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marina Johnson","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Helen Wagstaffe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Ralph","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Annabelle Mai","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Judith Breuer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Buckland","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Gilmour","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Goldblatt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"- The Co-Stars Study Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Joanne Slater-Jefferies","author_inst":"National Biofilms Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.213777","rel_title":"Cellular events of acute, resolving or progressive COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.213777","rel_abs":"We investigated the immune events following SARS-COV-2 infection, from the acute inflammatory state up to four weeks post infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with heterogeneous pulmonary pathology.

Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. This study provides valuable clues and frameworks to dissect the viral replication and virus-host interactions for designing effective therapeutics.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryFour dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and 5UTR CpG escape contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingsong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular"},{"author_name":"Junyan Kang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Andrology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excel"},{"author_name":"Mofang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Andrology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excel"},{"author_name":"Benhao Han","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Yongqun He","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, Chin"},{"author_name":"Luonan Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular"},{"author_name":"Toni P Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Brienna M Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Presan K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Chad J Roy","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Rudolph P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Tracy Fischer","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155341","rel_title":"A global survey on changes in the supply, price and use of illicit drugs and alcohol, and related complications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155341","rel_abs":"Background and aims: COVID-19 has infected more than 13 million people worldwide and impacted the lives of many more, with a particularly devastating impact on vulnerable populations, including people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Quarantines, travel bans, regulatory changes, social distancing and 'lockdown' measures have affected drug and alcohol supply chains and subsequently their availability, price and use patterns, with possible downstream effects on presentations of SUDs and demand for treatment. Given the lack of multicentric epidemiologic studies, we conducted a rapid global survey within the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) network in order to understand the status of substance-use patterns during the current pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Worldwide. Participants: Starting on April 4th, 2020 during a 5-week period, the survey received 185 responses from 77 countries. Measurements: To assess addiction medicine professionals' perceived changes in drug and alcohol supply, price, use pattern and related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Participants reported (among who answered ''decreased'' or ''increased'', percentage of those who were in majority is reported in the parenthesis) a decrease in drug supply (69.0%), and at the same time an increase in price (95.3%) globally. With respect to changes in use patterns, an increase in alcohol (71.7%), cannabis (63.0%), prescription opioids (70.9%), and sedative\/hypnotics (84.6%) use was reported while the use of amphetamines (59.7%), cocaine (67.5%), and opiates (58.2%) was reported to decrease overall. Conclusions: The global report on changes in the availability, use patterns and complications of alcohol and drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered in making new policies and in developing mitigating measures and guidelines during the current pandemic (and probable future ones) in order to minimize risks to SUDs. Key words: COVID-19, pandemic, alcohol, drug, substance use disorder, supply, price.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Farhoudian","author_inst":"Substance Abuse and Dependence Research Center, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Psychiatry, Tehran Univers"},{"author_name":"Seyed Ramin Radfar","author_inst":"UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs"},{"author_name":"Hossein Mohaddes Ardabili","author_inst":"Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Ibn-e-Sina Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Parnian Rafei","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Education, University of Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ebrahimy","author_inst":"Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Arash Khojasteh Zonoozi","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Cornelis A J De Jong","author_inst":"Behavioral Science Institute, Radboud University, the Netherlands."},{"author_name":"Mehrnoosh Vahidi","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Masud Yunesian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Christos Kouimtsidis","author_inst":"Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Shalini Arunogiri","author_inst":"Turning Point, Eastern Health, Box Hill, Australia"},{"author_name":"Helena Hansen","author_inst":"Departments of Anthropology and Psychiatry, New York University, USA"},{"author_name":"Kathleen T Brady","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, USA."},{"author_name":"Marc N Potenza","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling and Connecticut Mental Health Center, USA"},{"author_name":"- ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mario Baldacchino","author_inst":"Division of Population and Behaviour Sciences, Medical School, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Hamed Ekhtiari","author_inst":"Laureate Inst for Brain Research"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Paula Costello","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Ian Brown","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Nick Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Keith Godfrey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit"},{"author_name":"Veronica FOWLER","author_inst":"Eco Animal Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"addiction medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.214049","rel_title":"Intranasal Immunization with a Lentiviral Vector Coding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Confers Vigorous Protection in Pre-Clinical Animal Models","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.214049","rel_abs":"To develop a vaccine candidate against COVID-19, we generated a Lentiviral Vector (LV), eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.

As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the TMPRSS2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 280 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov modeling. We describe the binding mode of both drugs with TMPRSS2 in a Michaelis complex (MC) state preceding the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat to has a higher MC population, which in turn leads to the more frequent formation of the covalent complex and thus higher inhibition efficacy, as confirmed in vitro and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays.

We generated a unique dataset of 31,513 high quality APC, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multiprocess and previously unrecognized defects in anti-viral immune defense in specific APC compartments from severe patients: i) increase of pro-apoptotic genes exclusively in pDC, which are key effectors of antiviral immunity, ii) sharp decrease of innate sensing receptors, TLR7 and DHX9, in pDC and cDC1, respectively, iii) down-regulation of antiviral effector molecules, including Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in all monocyte subsets, and iv) decrease of MHC class II-related genes, and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) activity in cDC2, suggesting a viral inhibition of antigen presentation.
