Knowledge of community vulnerability to the disease would facilitate interventions aimed at transmission control by the efficient deployment of available limited resources. Therefore, we assessed spatial variations and heterogeneity of disease vulnerability among the population in 753 municipal units of Nepal. We collected geospatial indicators representing the domain of socioeconomic inequalities, population dynamics, heterogeneity in the accessibility and the information related to an underlying health condition which potentially affect the severity of COVID-19 transmission. Those indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices using Geographic Information System (GIS); Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two- Social and Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI). The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale and spatially overlaid via equally weighted arithmetic mean. The indices were classified into five level of risk and the municipal units and the population within vulnerabilities classes were quantified and visualized in the map. The index output indicated high vulnerability to epidemics in megacities like Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur, etc.; developing cities especially in the Province No 2; and, municipal units of Karnali and Sudoorpashchim provinces. Additionally, some other municipalities such as Dhulikhel, Beshishahar, Tansen etc. which have a higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders are highly vulnerable. The SVI indicated that 174 municipal units and 41.5% population is highly vulnerable. The EVI identified 55 municipal units and 40.7% of the total population of the country highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The SEVI accounted that disease vulnerability is high in 105 municipal units and 40% population of Nepal. The vulnerability indices created are means for different tiers of the existing government in federal system of Nepal for prioritization and improved planning for disease intervention especially in highly vulnerable municipal units where the COVID-19 transmission could have high severity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laxman Khanal","author_inst":"Tribhuvan University"},{"author_name":"Binod Kumar Paudel","author_inst":"Communication University of China, Beijing, PRC"},{"author_name":"Bipin Kumar Acharya","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.182550","rel_title":"Early postmortem mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with COVID-19 and correlation to tissue damage","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.182550","rel_abs":"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease.

It can be a diagnostic challenge to identify COVID-19 patients without bacterial co-infection in whom antibiotics can be safely stopped. We sought to evaluate the validity of a guideline that recommends withholding antibiotics in patients with a low serum procalcitonin (PCT). Methods. We retrospectively collected 28-day outcome data on patients admitted to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, between 5 March and 15 April 2020, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCT within 48 hours of diagnosis. PCT was considered negative if [&le;]0.25ng\/ml and positive if >0.25ng\/ml. Primary outcomes included antibiotic consumption, mortality, intensive care admission and length of hospital stay. Results. 368 patients met the inclusion criteria; 218 (59%) had a negative PCT and 150 (41%) positive. At 48 hours post-diagnosis, 73 (33%) of those with a negative PCT were receiving antimicrobials compared to 126 (84%) with a positive PCT (p<0.001), with a corresponding reduction in antimicrobial usage over 28 days (median DDD of 3.0 vs 6.8 (p<0.001); median DOT 2 vs 5 days (p<0.001) between the negative and positive PCT groups.) In the negative PCT group, there were fewer deaths (62 (28%) vs. 54 (36%), (p=0.021)) and critical care admissions (19 (9%) vs. 28 (19%), (p=0.007)) than in the positive PCT group. Median length of hospital stay was 8.7 and 9 days in the negative and positive PCT groups respectively. Conclusions. Procalcitonin is a valuable tool in the assessment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, safely reducing the potential burden of unnecessary antibiotic usage.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Jane Williams","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke Mair","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thushan I. de Silva","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dan J.

In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolae Sapoval","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005"},{"author_name":"Medhat Mahmoud","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael D.

Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced \u201cI see in 3D\u201d) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging \u201clifelong\u201d web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of \u201csharing of molecular scenes\u201d in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Youkharibache","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Raul Edouardo Cachau","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research: Frederick, MD, US"},{"author_name":"Thomas Madej","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Jiyao Wang","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Houda H.

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mei San Tang","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Franks","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Neil W Anderson","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Henderson","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Ann M Gronowski","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Christopher W Farnsworth","author_inst":"Washington University - St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Sonia Villapol","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kyle Hernandez","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL"},{"author_name":"Irina Maljkovic Berry","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Jon Foox","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York"},{"author_name":"Afshin Beheshti","author_inst":"KBR, Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA"},{"author_name":"Krista Ternus","author_inst":"Signature Science, LLC, 8329 North Mopac Expressway, Austin TX 78759"},{"author_name":"Kjersti M.

These results demonstrate the potential of a novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Chiuppesi","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Marcela Salazar Werner","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Heidi Contreras","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Hong Vu Nguyen","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Joy Martinez","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Soojin Park","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Jenny Nguyen","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Mindy Kha","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Angelina Iniguez","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Qiao Zhou","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Teodora Kaltcheva","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Roman Levytskyy","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Nancy D Ebelt","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Tae Hyuk Kang","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Xiwei Wu","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Tom Rogers","author_inst":"University of California at San Diego and Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Edwin R Manuel","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Yuriy Shostak","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Don J Diamond","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Felix Wussow","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Brenner","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive CAre Medicine, Essen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Markus A.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation\/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa\u2019s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270\/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2\/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271\/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A Henderson","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Neha Verma","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Jana Shen","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Tatjana Weil","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Ruediger Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Hirschenberger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Alina Seidel","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Susanne Klute","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"caterina Prelli-Bozzo","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Fabian Zech","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Nico Preising","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Fois","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Robin Lochbaum","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Philip Knaff","author_inst":"MPI Mainz"},{"author_name":"Volker Mailaender","author_inst":"MPI Mainz"},{"author_name":"Ludger Staendker","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Dietmar Thal","author_inst":"University Ulm"},{"author_name":"Christian Schumann","author_inst":"Clinics Kempten- Allgaeu"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Sparrer","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Guenter Lochnit","author_inst":"University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Manfred Frick","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Georg F.

We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism.

The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides \u201cRIRGGDGKMKDL\u201d and \u201cAFGRRGPEQTQGNFG\u201d were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onyeka S.

Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for covid-19. We say a model is simple if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policy strategies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations.To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call satellite equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his\/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effect of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, or death rates, or on nursing homes, and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our slightly complex Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. But, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have a big impact on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sana Jahedi","author_inst":"University of New Brunswick"},{"author_name":"James Yorke","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Iroanya O.

Methods: To retrieve the Vitamin D levels data, authors analyzed the Vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 ECTS Statement on Vitamin D Status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to used for analysis, only recently published data, that included general adult population of both genders ages 40-65 or wider, and must have included the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency. Results: There were 10 countries data sets that fit the criteria and were analyzed. Severe Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol\/L (10 ng\/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million from COVID-19 and prevalence of severe Vitamin D deficiency shows a strong correlation with r = 0.76, p = 0.01, indicating significant correlation. Correlation remained significant, even after adjusting for age structure of the population. Additionally, over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptoticaly increased. Conclusions: Authors recommend universal screening for Vitamin D deficiency, and further investigation of Vitamin D supplementation in randomized control studies, which may lead to possible treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isaac Z Pugach","author_inst":"Complete Med Care"},{"author_name":"Sofya Pugach","author_inst":"Complete Med Care"},{"author_name":"Iroanya O.

There is limited empirical research that examines the impact of these orders. We aimed to rapidly ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities (obtaining food, essential medications and childcare); and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of shelter-in-place orders for seven counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. Methods: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 - April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the U.S. Results: The percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty with obtaining food, hand sanitizer, and medications, particularly with obtaining food for both respondents from the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the shelter-in-place announcement.

Concomitantly, COVID-19 patients exhibit a state of hypercoagulability that can affect circuit lifespan. An optimal anticoagulation strategy is therefore needed in order to maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency of RRT. Methods Retrospective single-centre cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients at the University of Freiburg Medical Center. Included were all patients aged 18 years and older with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that were admitted to ICU between February 26 and May 21, 2020. We collected data on the COVID-19 disease course, AKI, RRT, thromboembolic events and anticoagulation. Primary outcome of the study was the effect of different anticoagulation strategies during RRT on extracorporeal circuit lifespans. Results Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or citrate. Mean treatment time in the UFH group was 21.3h (SEM: {+\/-}5.6h). Mean treatment time in the citrate group was 45.6h (SEM: {+\/-}2.7h). Citrate anticoagulation prolonged treatment duration significantly by 24.4h (p=0.0014). Anticoagulation during sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH, argatroban or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Mean dialysis time with UFH was 8.1h (SEM: {+\/-}1.3h), argatroban 8.0h (SEM: {+\/-}0.9h) and LMWH 11.8h (SEM: {+\/-}0.5h). Compared to UFH and argatroban, LMWH significantly prolonged treatment times by 3.7h (p=0.0082) and 3.8h (p=0.0024), respectively. Conclusions UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in dialysis circuits. For patients, who do not require an effective systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most effective strategy in our cohort. For patients, who require an effective systemic anticoagulation treatment, the usage of LMWH results in the longest circuit life spans.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic Arnold","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Westermann","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II: Division of Infectious Diseases, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germ"},{"author_name":"Elke Neumann-Haefelin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III: Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Frei"},{"author_name":"Gerd Walz","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yakup Tanriver","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Obi C.

We utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyd's tragic death on May 25, 2020, to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Our sample period spans from January 22, 2020, to June 20, 2020, and consists of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the change in COVID-19 case counts following the protests, we employ a differences in differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting, in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties. We also control for covariates that may influence COVID-19 transmission, and implement placebo tests using a Monte Carlo simulation. Findings: We document a country wide increase of over 3.06 cases per day, per 100,000 population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2.47-3.65), and a further increase of 1.73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place (95%CI: 0.59- 2.87). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests, this represents a 61.2% country wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and a further 34.6% increase in the protest counties. Interpretation: Our study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Gagnon","author_inst":"Smith School of Business, Queen's University"},{"author_name":"Jessica Lloyd","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Gagnon","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elke Neumann-Haefelin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III: Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Frei"},{"author_name":"Gerd Walz","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yakup Tanriver","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Obi C.

In particular, identifying high risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combatting the epidemic. This has been challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, because governmental agencies typically release aggregate COVID-19 data as marginal summary statistics of patient demographics. These data may identify disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between broad population subgroups, but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics. We introduce a method that overcomes the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates --- key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of COVID-19 --- for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. Our approach uses pseudo-likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate COVID-19 case and fatality data with population-level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. We illustrate our method on California COVID-19 data to estimate test-based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender, age, and race and ethnicity. Our analysis indicates that in California, males have higher test-based infection rates and test-based case fatality rates across age and race\/ethnicity groups, with the gender gap widening with increasing age. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. LatinX and African Americans have higher test-based infection rates than other race\/ethnicity groups. The subgroups with the highest 5 test-based case fatality rates are African American male, Multi-race male, Asian male, African American female, and American Indian or Alaska Native male, indicating that African Americans are an especially vulnerable California subpopulation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Xiong","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Gregory L.

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Abrams","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt & Global Health Institute (GHI), Depart"},{"author_name":"James Wambua","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Eva Santermans","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Elise Kuylen","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Sereina A.

However, a surge in diagnostic testing quickly resulted in worldwide competition for the same sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR diagnostic reagents (rRT-PCR). Consequently, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK sought to diversify their diagnostic portfolio by exploring alternative amplification chemistries including those that permit direct testing without RNA extraction. This study describes the validation of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay, which is an isothermal, autocycling, strand displacement nucleic acid amplification technique which can be performed on extracted RNA (RNA RT-LAMP) or directly from swab (Direct RT-LAMP). Analytical specificity (ASp) of this new RT-LAMP assay was 100% and analytical sensitivity (ASe) was between 1x101 and 1x102 copies when using a synthetic DNA target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of RNA RT LAMP was 97% and 99% respectively, relative to the standard of care (SoC) rRT-PCR. When a CT cut-off of 33 was employed, above which increasingly, evidence suggests there is a very low risk of patients shedding infectious virus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100%. The DSe and DSp of Direct-RT LAMP was 67% and 97%, respectively. When setting CT cut-offs of [&le;]33 and [&le;]25, the DSe increased to 75% and 100%, respectively. Time from swab-to-result for a strong positive sample (CT &lt 25) was &lt 15 minutes. We propose that RNA RT-LAMP could replace rRT-PCR where there is a need for increase in throughput, whereas Direct RT-LAMP could be used as a screening tool for triaging patients into appropriate hospitals wards, at GP surgeries and in care homes, or for population screening to identify highly contagious individuals (super shedders). Direct RT-LAMP could also be used during times of high prevalence to save critical extraction and rRT-PCR reagents by screening out those strong positives from diagnostic pipelines.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronica L Fowler","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bryony Armson","author_inst":"School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Jose L Gonzales","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR)"},{"author_name":"Emma L Wise","author_inst":"School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Emma L.

The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has proven to be a reliable and simple protocol that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in patient samples (<10 genomes per L) (Nagamine, Hase, and Notomi 2002) Recently, Rabe and Cepko at Harvard published a sensitive and simple protocol for COVID-19 RNA detection in saliva using an optimized LAMP assay (Rabe and Cepko, 2020). This LAMP protocol has the benefits of being simple, requiring no specialized equipment; rapid, requiring less than an hour from sample collection to readout; and cheap, costing around $1 per reaction using commercial reagents. The pH based colorimetric readout also leaves little ambiguity and is intuitive. However, a shortfall in many nucleic acid-based methods for detection in saliva samples has been the variability in output due to the presence of inhibitory substances in saliva. Centrifugation to separate the reaction inhibitors from inactivated sample was shown to be an effective way to ensure reliable LAMP amplification. However, a centrifuge capable of safely achieving the necessary speeds of 2000 RPM for several minutes often costs hundreds of dollars and requires a power supply. We present here an open hardware solution- Handyfuge - that can be assembled with readily available components for the cost of <5 dollars a unit and could be used together with the LAMP assay for point of care detection of COVID-19 RNA from saliva. The device is then validated using the LAMP protocol from Rabe and Cepko. With the use of insulated coolers for reagent supply chain and delivery, the assay presented can be completed without the need for electricity or any laboratory scale infrastructure.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Li","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adam Larson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anestha Kothari","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Manu Prakash","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emma L.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study took place, and data from 740 subjects, from all 32 states of Mexico, were analyzed. The association between the studied factors and severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) COVID-19 was evaluated through risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Severe illness was documented in 28% of participants. In multiple analysis, male gender (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.20), advanced age ([reference: 15 - 29 years old] 30 - 44, RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 - 1.11; 45 - 59, RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15 - 1.38; 60 years or older, RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 - 1.60), chronic kidney disease (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.64) and thoracic pain (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10 - 1.24) were associated with an increased risk of severe disease. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating predictors of COVID-19 severity in a large subset of the Latin-American population. It is also the first in documenting gender-related differences regarding the severity of the illness. These results may be useful for health care protocols for the early detection and management of COVID-19 patients that may benefit from opportune and specialized supportive medical treatment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Xochitl Trujillo","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Miguel Huerta","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Monica Rios-Silva","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Oliver Mendoza-Cano","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Zoe Vincent-Mistiaen","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fouch","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Connor J Maltby","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seden Grippon","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Munro","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jones","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tom Holmes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Tillyer","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Elwell","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Amy Sowood","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helio Santos","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Oliver de Peyer","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Dixon","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hatcher","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suvetha Sivanesan","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Knight","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clark","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen P Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Olsen","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin Oomatia","author_inst":"The Royal Free Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola O'Reilly","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Anett Rideg","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ok-Ryul Song","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amy Strange","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; University College London; University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Samra Turajlic","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; The Royal Marsden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philip A.

Methods: We retrospectively collected information about infected cases with COVID-19 from WHO situation reports, official notification websites of health ministries and reliable local newspapers from each country. Descriptive and cluster analysis was performed to describe the transmission characteristics while the logistic regression test was used to estimate the risk factors for the occurrence of an infected individual with an unknown source. Results: A total of 446 infected cases were recorded from 24 countries outside China until 12 February 2020, with the number of reported infected cases were doubled every 3.08 days (range from 2.6 to 3.9). Besides the spread from China, the transmission was originated from sub-endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Out of 6 countries got occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source and possible potential factors contributed to this occurrence was a time of epidemic circulating, number of patients and number of clusters when the occurrence still has not happened, and notably, the unreported situation of Chinese tourists information.

Methods We developed a dynamic COVID-19 microsimulation model to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes and cost-effectiveness of epidemic control strategies in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Interventions assessed were Healthcare Testing (HT), where diagnostic testing is performed only for those presenting to healthcare centres; Contact Tracing (CT) in households of cases; Isolation Centres (IC), for cases not requiring hospitalisation; community health worker-led Mass Symptom Screening and diagnostic testing for symptomatic individuals (MS); and Quarantine Centres (QC), for contacts who test negative. Given uncertainties about epidemic dynamics in South Africa, we evaluated two main epidemic scenarios over 360 days, with effective reproduction numbers (Re) of 1.5 and 1.2. We compared HT, HT+CT, HT+CT+IC, HT+CT+IC+MS, HT+CT+IC+QC, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC, considering strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <US$1,290\/year-of-life saved (YLS) to be cost-effective. Findings With Re 1.5, HT resulted in the most COVID-19 deaths and lowest costs over 360 days. Compared with HT, HT+CT+IC+MS reduced mortality by 76%, increased costs by 16%, and was cost-effective (ICER $350\/YLS). HT+CT+IC+MS+QC provided the greatest reduction in mortality, but increased costs by 95% compared with HT+CT+IC+MS and was not cost-effective (ICER $8,000\/YLS). With Re 1.2, HT+CT+IC+MS was the least costly strategy, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was not cost-effective (ICER $294,320\/YLS). Interpretation In South Africa, a strategy of household contact tracing, isolation, and mass symptom screening would substantially reduce COVID-19 mortality and be cost-effective. Adding quarantine centres for COVID-19 contacts is not cost-effective.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna P Reddy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fatma M Shebl","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julia H A Foote","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Harling","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Justine A Scott","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Panella","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Clare Flanagan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Emily P Hyle","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne M Neilan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amir M Mohareb","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linda-Gail Bekker","author_inst":"Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Richard J Lessells","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Andrea L Ciaranello","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robin Wood","author_inst":"Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elena Losina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Freedberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pooyan Kazemian","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hatcher","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suvetha Sivanesan","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Knight","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clark","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen P Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Olsen","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin Oomatia","author_inst":"The Royal Free Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola O'Reilly","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Anett Rideg","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ok-Ryul Song","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amy Strange","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; University College London; University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Samra Turajlic","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; The Royal Marsden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philip A.

Among several other effects this pandemic has wreaked havoc on the psychology and cognition of people across the globe. In this paper we attempted to find out the impact of lockdown and social isolation on the cognition and emotion of young healthy adults with high education (n=43) by means of a questionnaire sent through email. We found that more than 50% of the participants had some kind of emotional or cognitive (dysexecutive) symptoms, as calculated through emotional symptom index (ESI) and cognitive symptom index (CSI). The correlation between cognitive and emotional symptoms was also found to be moderately strong (0.59). Although it is a pilot study and larger samples are required to draw firm conclusion, the results argue in favor of a negative impact on the cognition and emotion of healthy educated young people caused by the COVID-19 related lockdown. It can be conjectured that, if taking an older sample with a lower education, emotional and cognitive changes would be more evident.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Durjoy Lahiri","author_inst":"Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, IPGME&R, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Souvik Dubey","author_inst":"Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, IPGME&R, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Ardila","author_inst":"I.M.

We performed a disease-disease phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using data representing 5,698 COVID-19 patients from a large academic medical center, stratified by race. We explore the association of 1,043 pre-occurring conditions with several COVID-19 outcomes: testing positive, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. Obesity, iron deficiency anemia and type II diabetes were associated with susceptibility in the full cohort, while ill-defined descriptions\/complications of heart disease and stage III chronic kidney disease were associated among non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black\/African American (NHAA) patients, respectively. The top phenotype hits in the full, NHW, and NHAA cohorts for hospitalization were acute renal failure, hypertension, and insufficiency\/arrest respiratory failure, respectively. Suggestive relationships between respiratory issues and COVID-19-related ICU admission and mortality were observed, while circulatory system diseases showed stronger association in NHAA patients. We were able to replicate some known comorbidities related to COVID-19 outcomes while discovering potentially unknown associations, such as endocrine\/metabolic conditions related to hospitalization and mental disorders related to mortality, for future validation. We provide interactive PheWAS visualization for broader exploration.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxwell Salvatore","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tian Gu","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jasmine A.
