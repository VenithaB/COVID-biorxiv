We estimate sero-prevalence for two periods flanking the start (March) and end (May) of first-wave mitigation measures in BC. Methods: Serial cross-sectional sampling was conducted using anonymized residual sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network, including children and adults in the Greater Vancouver Area (population ~3 million) where community attack rates were expected to be highest. Screening used two chemiluminescent immuno-assays for spike (S1) and nucleocapsid antibodies. Samples sero-positive on either screening assay were assessed by a third assay targeting the S1 receptor binding domain plus a neutralization assay. Age-standardized sero-prevalence estimates were based on dual-assay positivity. The May sero-prevalence estimate was extrapolated to the source population to assess surveillance under-ascertainment, quantified as the ratio of estimated infections versus reported cases. Results: Serum collection dates spanned March 5-13 and May 15-27, 2020. In March, two of 869 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.28% (95%CI=0.03-0.95). Neither specimen had detectable neutralizing antibodies. In May, four of 885 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.55% (95%CI=0.15-1.37%). All four specimens had detectable neutralizing antibodies. We estimate ~8 times more infections than reported cases. Conclusions: Less than 1% of British Columbians had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 when first-wave mitigation measures were relaxed in May 2020. Our findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in BC, but also substantial residual susceptibility. Further sero-survey snapshots are planned as the pandemic unfolds.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danuta M Skowronski","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Inna Sekirov","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Suzana Sabaiduc","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Macy Zou","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Data and Analytic Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Morshed","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"David Lawrence","author_inst":"BC  Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Kate Smolina","author_inst":"BC  Centre for Disease Control, Data and Analytic Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"May A Ahmed","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Eleni Galanis","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mieke Fraser","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Data and Analytic Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mayank Singal","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Monika Naus","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"David M Patrick","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Samantha Kaweski","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mill","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada, Health Security Infrastructure Branch, Canadian Public Health Service, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Romina C Reyes","author_inst":"LifeLabs, Department of Microbiology, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael T Kelly","author_inst":"LifeLabs, Department of Microbiology, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul N Levett","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Martin Petric","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Henry","author_inst":"Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Ministry of Health, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mel Krajden","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153056","rel_title":"Analysis of COVID-19 cases and associated ventilator requirement in Indian States","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153056","rel_abs":"Analysis of COVID-19 cases and prediction of quantity of associated ventilator requirement is very relevant during this pandemic.

Production of a low-cost and high-quality recombinant viral antigen can enable the development of reliable and affordable serological assays, which are urgently needed to facilitate epidemiological surveillance studies in low-income economies. Methods: Trimeric SARS-COV-2 spike (S) protein was produced in serum-free, suspension-adapted HEK293 cells. Highly purified S protein was used to develop an ELISA, named S-UFRJ test. It was standardized to work with different types of samples: (i) plasma or serum from venous blood samples; (ii) eluates from dried blood spots (DBS) obtained by collecting blood drops from finger prick. Findings: We developed a cost-effective, scalable technology to produce S protein based on its stable expression in HEK293 cells. Using this recombinant antigen we presented a workflow for test development in the setting of a pandemic, starting from limited amounts of samples up to reaching final validation with hundreds of samples. Test specificity was determined to be 98.6%, whereas sensitivity was 95% for samples collected 11 or more days after symptoms onset. A ROC analysis allowed optimizing the cut-off and confirming the high accuracy of the test. Endpoint titers were shown to correlate with virus neutralization assessed as PRNT90. There was excellent agreement between plasma and DBS samples, significantly simplifying sample collection, storing and shipping. An overall cost estimate revealed that final retail price could be in the range of one US dollar. Interpretation: The S-UFRJ assay developed herein meets the quality requirements of high sensitivity and specificity. The low cost and the use of mailable DBS samples allow for serological surveillance of populations regardless of geographical and socio-economic aspects, with special relevance for public health policy actions in low-income countries.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renata G.

Human-to-human transmission by close contact where large respiratory droplets play a significant role has been established as the main transmission route. At the same time the transmission by small aerosol is getting increasing attention. There is no distinct boundary between droplets and aerosol in nature so it is natural to investigate the infection risk due to aerosol. Here, we utilized a newly developed dose-response relation, combined with a box model for the exposure estimation, to quantitatively evaluate the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol transmission and compared with the risk due to close contact. The results indicated that the median infection risk via aerosol transmission was about 3.7x10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5x10-6 to 4.4x10-4) for one hour of exposure in a room with the size of 10 m (width)x10 m (length)x3 m (height) with one infected individual in it. The risk was more than three orders of magnitude lower than the risk at short distance, about 12.8% within 1 m, based on a meta-analysis. A simple exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90xD+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be utilized to characterize the magnitude of infection risk in the considered scenario based on the distance D from the infected individual. With prolonged exposure duration and large exposed population, the infection caused by aerosol transmission could be considerable, thus it is necessary to be cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in such situations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaole Zhang","author_inst":"1.

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 requiring ventilation is acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with multi-functional failure as a result of a cytokine storm with increased serum levels of cytokines such as TNF- and IL-6 being reported. TNF- levels are increased during the cytokine storm in very ill patients and soluble receptors for IL-6 and IL-2 are present in the blood of COVID-19 patients, Objectives: To elucidate the involvement of serum levels of soluble TNF-Receptor of severe and mild COVID-19 patients to determine for severity of disease. Method: We recruited 16 severe COVID-19 patients in the ICU on ventilator support and 26 milder COVID-19 patients who were hospitalised but not within the intensive care unit (ICU) between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. After harvesting of whole blood the serum was isolated and soluble TNF-Receptor levels measured by ELISA. Results: Serum levels of the usually inhibitory soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFaR1) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients at admission to ICU. High serum levels of sTNFaR1 were associated with mortality of severe COVID-19 patients treated within ICU. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates for role of STNF-aR1 receptor in severity of disease. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFaR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esmaeil Mortaz","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Payam Tabarsi","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Hamidreza Jamaati","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Neda Dalil Roofchayee","author_inst":"Departement of Immunology"},{"author_name":"Neda KakaDezfuli","author_inst":"Departement of Immunology"},{"author_name":"Seyed MohammadReza Hashemian","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Afshin Moniri","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Majid Marjani","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Majid Malekmohammd","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Davood Manosuri","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Mohammd Varahram","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Gert Folkerts","author_inst":"UIPS"},{"author_name":"Ian M Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial London College"},{"author_name":"Leonardo H.

Specifically, it investigates work and personal predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker, evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, risk-aversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to prevent or contain transmission.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Anand","author_inst":"Open University, London School of Economics, Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Heidi Allen","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Robert Ferrer","author_inst":"University of Texas at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Natalie Gold","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Rolando Manuel Gonzales Martinez","author_inst":"Agder University"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Melanie Krause","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Francis Vergunst","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Majid Malekmohammd","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Davood Manosuri","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Mohammd Varahram","author_inst":"NRITLD"},{"author_name":"Gert Folkerts","author_inst":"UIPS"},{"author_name":"Ian M Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial London College"},{"author_name":"Leonardo H.

The disease has rapidly spread to most countries and territories and hascaused 14.2 million confirmed infections and 602,037 deaths as of July 19th 2020. Massive molecular testing for COVID-19 has been pointed as fundamental to moderate the spread of the disease. Pooling methods can enhance the efficiency of testing, but they are viable only at very low incidences of the disease. We propose Smart Pooling, a machine learning method that uses clinical and sociodemographic data from patients to increase the efficiency of pooled molecular testing for COVID-19 by arranging samples into all-negative pools. Methods: We developed machine learning methods that estimate the probability that a sample will test positive for SARS-Cov-2 based on complementary information from the sample. We use these predictions to exclude samples predicted as positive from pools. We trained our machine learning methods on a dataset of 2000 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2 from April to July in Bogota, Colombia. Findings: Our method, Smart Pooling, shows efficiency of 306% at a disease prevalence of 5% and efficiency of 107% at disease a prevalence of up to 50%, a regime in which two-stage pooling offers marginal efficiency gains compared to individual testing. Additionally, we calculate the possible efficiency gains of one- and two-dimensional two-stage pooling strategies, and present the optimal strategies for disease prevalences up to 25%. We discuss practical limitations to conduct pooling in the laboratory. Interpretation: Pooled testing has been a theoretically alluring option to increase the coverage of diagnostics since its proposition by Dorfmann during World War II. Although there are examples of successfully using pooled testing to reduce the cost of diagnostics, its applicability has remained limited because efficiency drops rapidly as prevalence increases. Not only does our method provide a cost-effective solution to increase the coverage of testing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also demonstrates that artificial intelligence can be used complementary with well-established techniques in the medical praxis.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Escobar","author_inst":"Universidad de Los Andes"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Jeanneret","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Laura Bravo-S\u00e1nchez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Angela Castillo","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Catalina G\u00f3mez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Diego Valderrama","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Maria F.

Reported estimates have varied greatly, but many have derived from biased samples, and inadequate testing methods. Objective: To estimate the range of valid seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations, and compare these seroprevalence estimates with the cumulative cases seen in the same population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints from January 2020 to 25 May 2020 that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and\/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of either the general community or of defined sub-populations, such healthcare workers and other organizations. Results: Of the 837 studies identified, 49 were assessed and 14 were includable. Included studies represented 10 countries and 100,557 subjects: 9 from randomly selected populations, 2 from healthcare workers, 2 from industry populations, and 1of parturient women. The seroprevalence proportions in 10 studies ranged between 1%-10%, and 2 study estimates under 1%, and 2 over 10% - from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt in Germany and from Northwest Iran. The two studies in healthcare workers, in Italy and Spain, had seroprevalence rates at higher range of estimates, with the Barcelona hospitals having a higher rate than the Spanish national survey. For only one study was the seroprevalence estimate higher than the cumulative incidence, though these were proximate for several studies. In five studies, the seroprevalence was similar to the cumulative case numbers in the same population. For seropositive cases not previously detected as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 mostly less than 10% with the level of infection lower in the general community, suggesting levels well below herd immunity. The similarity of seroprevalence and reported cases is several studies, and high symptom rates in seropositive cases suggest that gaps between seroprevalence rates and reported cases are likely due to undertesting of symptomatic people.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oyungerel Byambasuren","author_inst":"Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Bond University"},{"author_name":"Claudia C Dobler","author_inst":"Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Bond University"},{"author_name":"Katy Bell","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Diana Patricia Rojas","author_inst":"College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences, Division of Tropical Health & Medicine, James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Bond University"},{"author_name":"Juli\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Jorge Madrid-Wolff","author_inst":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Martha Cepeda","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Marcela Guevara-Suarez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Olga L.

This prompted the initiation of teleconsult follow-up in our department. The study outlines the experience of tele-follow-up at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, and the perspective of neurologists about this novel approach. Methods: The tele-follow-up was started from 26th March 2020. Data of follow up appointments was provided by the medical record section. The faculty and senior residents conducted the tele-follow-up. Communication was made via voice calls. The data for initial ten days was analyzed to find the utility and experience of the new service. Results: In the initial ten working days, data of 968 patients was provided for tele-follow-up. A successful communication was made in 50.3% patients (contact with patients: 27.7% and family members 22.6%). The phone numbers which were not contactable\/invalid\/not available constituted 36.8% of the data. A total of 35 faculty and residents conducted the tele-follow-up. The utility of tele-follow-up was perceived as good by 71.4% of neurologists. Majority of neurologists (71.4%) observed that [&ge;]90% of patients were continuing medications. Patients outside the city constituted 50-75% of the list. The survey revealed that all neurologists felt the need to continue tele-follow-up for far off stable patients post lock down and resumption of regular outpatient services. Conclusion: The survey established the feasibility and utility of teleconsult for follow up of patients with neurological diseases who were attending the regular outpatient services before the lock down.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Deepti Vibha","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"MV Padma Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Kameshwar Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Manjari Tripathi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Achal Kumar Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rohit Bhatia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mamta Bhushan Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Vishnu VY","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Roopa Rajan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anu Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Animesh Das","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Elavarsi A","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Divya MR","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Bhargavi Ramanujam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ahmadullah Shariff","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Silvia Restrepo","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Pablo Arbelaez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Martin Petric","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Henry","author_inst":"Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Ministry of Health, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mel Krajden","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152959","rel_title":"Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152959","rel_abs":"Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Lee W Riley","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kameshwar Prasad","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Manjari Tripathi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Achal Kumar Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rohit Bhatia","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Mamta Bhushan Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Vishnu VY","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Roopa Rajan","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Kumar Singh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Anu Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Animesh Das","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Elavarsi A","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Divya MR","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Bhargavi Ramanujam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ahmadullah Shariff","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Silvia Restrepo","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Pablo Arbelaez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Martin Petric","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Henry","author_inst":"Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Ministry of Health, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mel Krajden","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152991","rel_title":"Climate & BCG: Effects on COVID-19 DeathGrowth Rates","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152991","rel_abs":"Multiple studies have suggested the spread of COVID-19 is affected by factors such as climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and blood type.

Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 microns). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs, reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count\/cubic foot (pc\/ft3) within six channel sizes: 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and >10 microns. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L\/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p-values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS Aerosol emissions increased with increased air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3-3 microns). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 microns) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc\/ft3 at 1, 3 and 5 L\/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H2O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L\/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSIONS A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter. These data should be considered when designing measures to reduce in-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CLODAGH DUFFY","author_inst":"MEDICAL DEVICES UNIT, NHS GREATER GLASGOW & CLYDE, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"ANDREW KIDD","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"SARAH FRANCIS","author_inst":"MEDICAL DEVICES UNIT, NHS GREATER GLASGOW & CLYDE, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"SELINA TSIM","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"LAURA MCNAUGHTON","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"KATIE FERGUSON","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"JENNY FERGUSON","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"GARY RODGERS","author_inst":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE McGROARTY","author_inst":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"ROBIN SAYER","author_inst":"MEDICAL DEVICES UNIT, NHS GREATER GLASGOW & CLYDE, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"KEVIN G BLYTH","author_inst":"INSTITUTE OF CANCER SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, UK\/GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"Animesh Das","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Elavarsi A","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Divya MR","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Bhargavi Ramanujam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ahmadullah Shariff","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Silvia Restrepo","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Pablo Arbelaez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Martin Petric","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Henry","author_inst":"Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Ministry of Health, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mel Krajden","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150714","rel_title":"Endocrine disrupting chemicals and COVID-19 relationships: a computational systems biology approach","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150714","rel_abs":"Background: Patients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. Objectives: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. Methods: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. Results: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE\/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. Conclusions: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qier Wu","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Xavier Coumoul","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Philippe Grandjean","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health; University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Robert Barouki","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Karine Audouze","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"KATIE FERGUSON","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"JENNY FERGUSON","author_inst":"GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"GARY RODGERS","author_inst":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"CLAIRE McGROARTY","author_inst":"EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"ROBIN SAYER","author_inst":"MEDICAL DEVICES UNIT, NHS GREATER GLASGOW & CLYDE, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"KEVIN G BLYTH","author_inst":"INSTITUTE OF CANCER SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, UK\/GLASGOW PLEURAL DISEASE UNIT, QUEEN ELIZABETH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, UK"},{"author_name":"Animesh Das","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Elavarsi A","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Divya MR","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Bhargavi Ramanujam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Ahmadullah Shariff","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Silvia Restrepo","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Pablo Arbelaez","author_inst":"Universidad de los Andes"},{"author_name":"Martin Petric","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Henry","author_inst":"Office of the Provincial Health Officer, Ministry of Health, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Mel Krajden","author_inst":"BC Centre for Disease Control, Public Health Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"toxicology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20151852","rel_title":"Effect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: Preliminary results from a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial.","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20151852","rel_abs":"Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of in vitro activity, uncontrolled data, and small randomized studies. Methods: The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We report the preliminary results for the comparison of hydroxychloroquine vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results: 1561 patients randomly allocated to receive hydroxychloroquine were compared with 3155 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 418 (26.8%) patients allocated hydroxychloroquine and 788 (25.0%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.23; P=0.18). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60.3% vs. 62.8%; rate ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99) and those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25). There was no excess of new major cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality but was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Horby","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Marion Mafham","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Louise Linsell","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Bell","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Natalie Staplin","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Emberson","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin Wiselka","author_inst":"University Hospitals fo Leicester NHS Trust and University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ustianowski","author_inst":"Regional Infectious Diseases Unit, North Manchester General Hospital & University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Einas Elmahi","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Prudon","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, North Tees & Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Anthony Whitehouse","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Microbiology & Infection, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"Univeristy of Manchester and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"John Williams","author_inst":"James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jakki Faccenda","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Underwood","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board;

From the three, SARS-CoV-2 has spread world-wide and to July 2020 it has been responsible for more than 11 million confirmed cases and over half a million deaths. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, social distancing has been the most effective measure to control the pandemic. However it has become evident that as the virus spreads the only tool that will allow us to fully control it is an effective vaccine. There are currently more than 150 vaccine candidates in different stages of development using a variety of viral antigens, with the S protein being the most targeted antigen. Although some new experimental evidence suggests cross-reacting responses between coronaviruses are present in the population, it remains unknown whether potential shared antigens between different coronaviruses could provide cross-protection. Given that coronaviruses are emerging pathogens and continue to represent a threat to global health, the development of a SARS-Cov-2 vaccine that could provide  universal protection against other coronaviruses should be pushed forward. Here we present a thorough review of reported B and T cell epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and other relevant coronaviruses, in addition we used web-based tools to predict novel B and T cell epitopes that have not been reported before. Analysis of experimental evidence that is constantly emerging complemented with the findings of this study allow us support the hypothesis that cross-reactive responses, particularly those coming from T cells, might play a key role in controlling infection by SARS-CoV-2. We hope that with the evidence presented in this manuscript we provide arguments to encourage the study of cross-reactive responses in order to elucidate their role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Finally we expect our findings will aid targeted analysis of antigen-specific immune responses and guide future vaccine design aiming to develop a cross reactive effective vaccine against respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana Laura Pacheco-Olvera","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Saint Remy-Hernandez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Ernesto Acevedo-Ochoa","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Arriaga-Pizano","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Arturo Cerbulo-Vazquez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Ferat-Osorio","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, Division de Investigacion en Salud, Servicio de Gastrocirugia, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medic"},{"author_name":"Tania Rivera-Hernandez","author_inst":"Catedras CONACYT.

The roles and characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe on humans. The detection of the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide perspective for treatment. We developed alignment-free machine learning approaches for an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide. We performed extensive experiments through six different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms in combination with digital signal processing to infer the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses using previous existing strains. The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human coronaviruses. Our study achieves high levels of prediction performance based on raw RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge. The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this alignment-free machine learning-based approach can offer a reliable real-time estimation for its viral lethality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui YIN","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Zihan Luo","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chee Keong Kwoh","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Arriaga-Pizano","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Arturo Cerbulo-Vazquez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Ferat-Osorio","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, Division de Investigacion en Salud, Servicio de Gastrocirugia, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medic"},{"author_name":"Tania Rivera-Hernandez","author_inst":"Catedras CONACYT.

This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility as well as antigenic shift to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we aimed at genome-wide analyses of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses for the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their spatial distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 441 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 21 being distinctive to India. Emergence of novel mutations were observed in S glycoprotein (7\/33), NSP3 (6\/33), RdRp\/NSP12 (4\/33), NSP2 (2\/33) and N (2\/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.4 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on the co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that representative strain of each group divided themselves into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. India was dominated by A2a clade (55.60%) followed by A3 (37.38%) and B (7%), but exhibited heterogeneous distribution among various geographical regions. The A2a clade mostly predominated in East India, Western India and Central India, whereas A3 clade prevailed in South and North India. In conclusion, this study highlights the divergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains and co-circulation of multiple clades in India. Monitoring of the emerging mutations would pave ways for vaccine formulation and designing of antiviral drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rakesh Sarkar","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Suvrotoa Mitra","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Pritam Chandra","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Saha","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Anindita Banerjee","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shanta Dutta","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Mamta Chawla-Sarkar","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases"},{"author_name":"Constantino Lopez-Macias","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica, UMAE Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMS"},{"author_name":"Einas Elmahi","author_inst":"Research and Development Department, Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Prudon","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, North Tees & Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Anthony Whitehouse","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Microbiology & Infection, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy Felton","author_inst":"Univeristy of Manchester and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"John Williams","author_inst":"James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jakki Faccenda","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Underwood","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board;

Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction5. Here we report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naive human Fab library. Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the \"up\" and the other in the \"down\" position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bei Wang","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Daniel Asarnow","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hsin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Ching-Wen Huang","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Bryan Faust","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia Miang Lon Ng","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Eve Zi Xian Ngoh","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Markus Bohn","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andres Pizzorno","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Hwee Ching Tan","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Chia Yin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Rabiatul Adawiyah Minhat","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Olivier Terrier","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Mun Kuen Soh","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Frannie Jiuyi Teo","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Yee Chin Yeap","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Yuanyu Hu","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Shirley Gek Kheng Seah","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Maurer-Stroh","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Laurent Renia","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Brendon John Hanson","author_inst":"DSO National Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Aashish Manglik","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yifan Cheng","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles S Craik","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Cheng-I Wang","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network, A*STAR"},{"author_name":"Richard Haynes","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204610","rel_title":"Antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in response to immune pressure","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204610","rel_abs":"The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially driven by the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the virus.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Forni","author_inst":"Scientific Institute IRCCS E.

Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2\/8 and 1\/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct [&ge;]25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7\/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Charre","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ginevra","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Marina Sabatier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Regue","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Gwendolyne Burfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Caroline Scholtes","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204602","rel_title":"Evidence of SARS-CoV2 entry protein ACE2 in the human nose and olfactory bulb","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204602","rel_abs":"Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptom. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human, post-mortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium.\n\nOur findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia of via the olfactory pathway.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz Klingenstein","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Klingenstein","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Peter Helmut Neckel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas F Mack","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peter Wagner","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Liebau","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alfio Milazzo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.203059","rel_title":"The Effect Of Famotidine On SARS-CoV-2 Proteases And Virus Replication","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.203059","rel_abs":"The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madeline Loffredo","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hector Lucero","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Da-Yuan Chen","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Simon Bergqvist","author_inst":"Biofizik, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Munawar","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Asanga Bandara","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steff DeGraef","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stephen D.

Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g\/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g\/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng\/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng\/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g\/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g\/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.\n\nIMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Diana Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Nathen E Bopp","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Patricia V Aguilar","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"K Jagannadha Sastry","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Robert A Newman","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Ali H Munawar","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204404","rel_title":"A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204404","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nora Schmidt","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Caleb A Lareau","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Hasmik Keshishian","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Randy Melanson","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Matthias Zimmer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Luisa Kirschner","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Jens Ade","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Werner","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Neva Caliskan","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Eric S Lander","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.205229","rel_title":"The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier: Kinetics, distribution, mechanisms, and influence of ApoE genotype, sex, and inflammation","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.205229","rel_abs":"Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 {+\/-} 0.024 L\/g-min and 0.294 {+\/-} 0.032 L\/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1\/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood. ApoE isoform or sex did not affect whole brain uptake, but had variable effects on olfactory bulb, liver, spleen, and kidney uptakes. In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Rhea","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Aric F Logsdon","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kim M Hansen","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Williams","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"May Reed","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kristen Baumann","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Holden","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"Jacob Raber","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"William A Banks","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Michelle A Erickson","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20148387","rel_title":"Impact of COVID-19 on 2020 US life expectancy for the Black and Latino populations","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20148387","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has resulted in a staggering death toll in the US: over 180,000 by the end of August 2020, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths - one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our most likely estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.41 years. This decline results in a life expectancy of 77.2 years, a value last observed in 2003. We also project a 1.08-year reduction in life expectancy at age 65. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.69 and 3.66 years, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.84-year reduction for whites. These projections imply an increase of over 50% in the Black-white life expectancy gap, from 3.6 to 5.5 years, thereby eliminating twenty years of progress made in reducing this differential. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than three-year survival advantage almost eliminated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Andrasfay","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Noreen Goldman","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Kim M Hansen","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Williams","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"May Reed","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kristen Baumann","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Holden","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"Jacob Raber","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"William A Banks","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Michelle A Erickson","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin J Landray","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
