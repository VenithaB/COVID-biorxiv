Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhen Zhao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haodong Cui","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenxing Song","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ru","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.963546","rel_title":"An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.963546","rel_abs":"The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25\/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL\/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles V Herst","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Scott Burkholz","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"John Sidney","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Paul E Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Edecio Cunha-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela S Rosa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"William Chong Hang Chao","author_inst":"University of Macau"},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Serban Ciotlos","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Peter Lloyd","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Reid Martin Rubsamen","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc & Massachusetts General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.24.963348","rel_title":"Increasing Host Cellular Receptor--Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Expression by Coronavirus may Facilitate 2019-nCoV Infection","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.24.963348","rel_abs":"The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Scott Burkholz","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"John Sidney","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Paul E Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Edecio Cunha-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela S Rosa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"William Chong Hang Chao","author_inst":"University of Macau"},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Serban Ciotlos","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Peter Lloyd","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Reid Martin Rubsamen","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc & Massachusetts General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.964882","rel_title":"Structure-based drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening rapidly identify antiviral leads targeting COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.964882","rel_abs":"A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 M. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenming Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Du","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yongqiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Meiqin Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yao Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yinkai Duan","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kailin Yang","author_inst":"Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Rendi Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Xinglou Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Ting Sun","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"YuFei He","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Wendong Li","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Yubo Fan","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yinkai Duan","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kailin Yang","author_inst":"Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Rendi Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Xinglou Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufang Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chaohua Deng","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Zou","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Weiyong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yu","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jong-Hwan Lee","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Cheol Woo Byeon","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Joong Jin Lee","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Jin-soo Maeng","author_inst":"Korea Food Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Seong Jun Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Seung Il Kim","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Bum-Tae Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Min Jun Lee","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Hong Gi Kim","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2\/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ji","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers and Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing    2.

Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liangsheng Zhang","author_inst":"FAfu"},{"author_name":"Jian-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenguo Zhang","author_inst":"Independent Scholar, Irvine, CA, 92612.

Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and thus contribute to the control of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lianlian Wu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dexin Gong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yilin Zhao","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shan Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Yonggui Wang","author_inst":"China University of Geosciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Biqing Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Kuo Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Huiling Wu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zehua Dong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Minfeng Liao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jin Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanling Wen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Lin Chen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui Qi","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chao Ye","author_inst":"Shandong Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang-rong Qin","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xue-Jie Yu","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China."},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Lin Chen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"li Xu","author_inst":"Shenyang Fourth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shengjing Hospital of Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Song","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baijun Sun","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jinping Mu","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Dong","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control  and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 {+\/-} 15.0 years vs 48.9 {+\/-} 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Mao","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mengdie Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shanghai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Quanwei He","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Candong Hong","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yifan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute\/Saint Joseph Hospital Medical Center Phoenix"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The disease was caused by SARS-CoV, 17 years apart, also happen in China, and SARS-CoV-2, this epidemic has posed a significant hazard to people health both China and the whole world. Objective: Summarized the latest epidemiological changes, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination and pathological characteristics of COVID-19. Evidence Review: PubMed database were searched from 2019 to 2020 using the index terms novel coronavirus or COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 and synonyms. Articles that reported clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were included and were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics. Results: 34 COVID-19-related articles were eligible for this systematic review;Four of the articles were related to pathology. We found that Fever (86.0%), cough (63.9%) and Malaise\/Fatigue (34.7%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in the lungs. Interpretation: The clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. The latest finds of pathological examination on COVID-19 may upend existing treatment schemes, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker is very important.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"mao yaqian","author_inst":"Department of endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"FujianProvincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Candong Hong","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yifan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute\/Saint Joseph Hospital Medical Center Phoenix"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16\/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10\/25, 40%), heart diseases (8\/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5\/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4\/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2\/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2\/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1\/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17\/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18\/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22\/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19\/21), 85% (19\/20) and 100% (21\/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15\/16, 93.8%), PCT (11\/11, 100%), CRP (11\/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8\/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11\/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9\/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14\/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Luwen Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shaonan Yan","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fan Yang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Longkui Xiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiling Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zuojiong Gong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunbao Pan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Guangming Ye","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiantao Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojiao Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xianghu Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Guo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qiaoling Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Hong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72 and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70 and 12.42 respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1 increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1 increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mao Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Aili Jiang","author_inst":"Deparment of Occupatinal and Environmetal Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Gong","author_inst":"Deparment of Occupatinal and Environmetal Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lina Luo","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Guo","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chuyi Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zheng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyong Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bixing Yang","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jietong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Youping Chen","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ke Zheng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age ([&ge;]65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jian-Min Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Bai","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shi Liu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jin-Kui Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qianyun Wang","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianli Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Tong Shen","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Hunter Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yali Cui","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Northwest University"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197\/276) and 57.2% (158\/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuefei Cai","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jieli Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Quanxin Long","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haijun Deng","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Fan","author_inst":"PEG-Bio Biopharm Co.

Aim To reveal more data on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, in Zhejiang, China. Design Retrospective case series. Methods 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. Results Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan\/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia. Conclusions Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guo-Qing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nai-Bin Yang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Ding","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Ada Hoi Yan Ma","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Zong-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Ninghai County First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue-Fei Shen","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chun-Wei Shi","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang Lian","author_inst":"Xiangshan County People First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Guo Chu","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Da-Wei Ren","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weiliang Cao","author_inst":"Xiangyang No1 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nai-Bin Yang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Ding","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Ada Hoi Yan Ma","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo China"},{"author_name":"Zong-Yi Wang","author_inst":"Ninghai County First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue-Fei Shen","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chun-Wei Shi","author_inst":"Xiaoshan District People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang Lian","author_inst":"Xiangshan County People First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Guo Chu","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Da-Wei Ren","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Ernesto Ortega","author_inst":"Universidad de la Habana"},{"author_name":"Marco Mancastroppa","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite, Orange Experience Design Lab"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Boelle","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Lei Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Da-Wei Ren","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.

Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9-6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8-5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Daozhou Gao","author_inst":"Shanghai Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zian Zhuang","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Marc Chong","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yongli Cai","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Ran","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peihua Cao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xue-Qin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua-Jiang Shen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Min Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo City First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"The Public Health Center, Chongqing"},{"author_name":"Yuan Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yong Lin","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jihua Ren","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Luyi Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Gan","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanmeng Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Amei Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fachun Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"BioScience Co.
