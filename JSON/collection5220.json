Effective public health measures for reducing R are recommended. Method: A multiple linear regression model was constructed to model the statistical relationship between P and R in China and in Wuhan, from 1 January to 20 March 2020. We carefully accounted for potential key confounders and addressed collinearity. The causal relationship between P and R, and the interaction effect between key variables were investigated. Finding: A causal relationship between P and R across 31 provincial capital cities in China was established via matching. A higher P resulted in a higher R in China. A 10 g\/m3 increase in P gave a 0.9% increase in R (p < 0.05). An interaction analysis between P and absolute humidity (AH) showed a statistically significant positive relationship between P x AH and R (p < 0.01). When AH was [&le;] 8.6 g\/m3, higher P and AH gave a higher R (p < 0.01). Interpretation: Given that P can exacerbate R, we recommend the installation of air purifiers and improving air ventilation to reduce the effect of P on R. Given that an increasing AH that falls below 8.6 g\/m3 exacerbated R, dehumidifiers can be used to reduce AH and R. Further, given the increasing discussions\/observations that COVID-19 can be airborne, surgical masks should be used to protect one from contracting the virus via the viral-particulate transmission pathway.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline C.K.

Makkah annually receives three million pilgrims who perform Hajj. Although precautionary measures have been taken in Saudi Arabia to slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as locking down the most affected cities, practicing social distancing, and applying the infection-control precautions, the number of cases has increased. The total confirmed number of cases in Makkah was 10,709 with 127 deaths as of May 16, 2020. Aims of the study: Forecasting the COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah will help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of the fight against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia, specifically in Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah. Method: The Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model has been used to track the transmission dynamics and growth among the city of Makkah. The growth index was calculated, according to the data from March 16 until May 9. The estimated vital epidemiological parameters, such as forecasting works and transmission rates, were done. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 12th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 22nd of May. Then, the number of cases will start to decrease. Conclusion: Using the SIR model, the result predicts the disease progression peak and an estimated end of COVID-19 in the city of Makkah to help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alaa F Mujallad","author_inst":"University of Jeddah"},{"author_name":"haitham khoj","author_inst":"king Abdulaziz  university"},{"author_name":"Mina Aghaei","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Jon Crowcroft","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Technology, The University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Peiyang Guo","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jinqi Fu","author_inst":"MRC Cancer Unit, Department of Oncology, The University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Andong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Illana Gozes","author_inst":"Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Adams Super Center for Brain Studies and Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel"},{"author_name":"Zafar Gilani","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, , Queen Mary University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20106500","rel_title":"The estimated impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in the general population of France","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20106500","rel_abs":"The authors have withdrawn their manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments to test some of their conclusions further.

This reality is more accentuated especially in Ecuador, where, although many healthcare workers have been called to help in the regions most affected; the shortage of them combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation on the front line of the last year medical students are indispensable. For that reason, appropriate training on COVID-19 to last year medical students is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian last year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns, which could guide the design of better medical educational curricula on COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian last year medical students. It was sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. Results: A total of 309 students answered the survey. 88% (274\/309) of students scored high about knowledge of the disease (more than 16 points). The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of the COVID-19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak in 77% (238\/309) and 58% (179\/309) of the students, respectively. Moreover 91% (280\/309) of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment, neither training in their health facilities (49%, 152\/309). Conclusions: The high level of students knowledge is an important opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training toward COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained. Hopefully with this, negative attitudes will change and students will be better qualified.

Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that the closure of service activities is very effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality - this was about 15% lower in municipalities with a 10 percentage points higher employment share in shut down services. Shutting down factories, instead, is much less effective, plausibly because factory workers engage in more limited physical interactions relative to those in the consumer-facing service sector. Concerning the management of the health care system, we find that mortality strongly increases with distance from the intensive care unit (ICU). Municipalities at 10 km from the closest ICU experienced up to 50% higher mortality. This effect - which is largest within the epicenter and in days of abnormally high volumes of calls to the emergency line - underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital emergency services and building ambulance capacity to ensure timely transportation of critical patients to the ICU.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriele Ciminelli","author_inst":"MIT Sloan School of Management"},{"author_name":"S\u00edlvia Garcia-Mandic\u00f3","author_inst":"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development"},{"author_name":"Thomas Radulesco","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University, APHM, IUSTI, La Conception University Hospital, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Carlos M Chiesa-Estomba","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Luigi A Vaira","author_inst":"Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy."},{"author_name":"Giacomo De Riu","author_inst":"Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy."},{"author_name":"Leigh J Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire Hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Nataly Espinoza-Suarez","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Golembiewski","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Percy Soto-Becerra","author_inst":"Facultad de Administracion y Salud Publica, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20106641","rel_title":"Study Data Element Mapping: Feasibility of Defining Common Data Elements Across COVID-19 Studies","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20106641","rel_abs":"Background: Numerous clinical studies are now underway investigating aspects of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and\/or multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping to improve research data management. Methods: 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality. Results: Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures. Conclusion: The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priscilla Mathewson","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ben Gordon","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Kay Snowley","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Clara Fennessy","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Neil Sebire","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London"},{"author_name":"Leigh J Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire Hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Nataly Espinoza-Suarez","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Golembiewski","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Percy Soto-Becerra","author_inst":"Facultad de Administracion y Salud Publica, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20106799","rel_title":"Use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system and COVID-19 prognosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20106799","rel_abs":"Background: controversy has arisen in the scientific community on whether the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 would be of benefit or harmful. A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected patients who were under treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effect models or random-effect models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates. Results: a total of fifteen studies with 21,614 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a non-significant 20% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.63-1.04), p=0.10, I2=82%. In a subgroup analysis that included hypertensive subjects only, ACEI\/ARB were associated with a 27% significant decrease in the risk of the composite outcome (RR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.56-0.96), p=0.02, I2=65%).

It has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies in only a few months. COVID-19 presents numerous challenges to all aspects of healthcare, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications to healthcare. Machine learning is a subset of AI that employs deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than humans. In this manuscript, we explore the potential for a simple and widely available test as a chest x-ray (CXR) to be utilized with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision. Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. Finally, we developed and described a publicly available website to demonstrate how this technology can be made readily available in the future.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew A Borkowski","author_inst":"James A.

We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=111 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27\/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected [&ge;]28 days post symptom onset, 0\/143 (0%, 95%CI 0.0-2.5%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Carolina V Arancibia - Carcamo","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, University of Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16IntCD44lowCD11bInt low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF- levels, particularly for CD40+ LDIBs. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha M Morrissey","author_inst":"University of Louisville.edu"},{"author_name":"Anne E Geller","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Hu","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"David Tieri","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Cooke","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Chuanlin Ding","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Matthew Woeste","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Huang-ge Zhange","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Cavallazi","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Sean P Clifford","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"James Chen","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Maiying Kong","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Corey T Watson","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jiapeng Huang","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transfusion, 26 Margaret St, Marylebone, London W1W 8NB"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Samreen Ijaz","author_inst":"Public Health England, Porton Down, SP4 0JG, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim James","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"William James","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, OX1 3RE, UK"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Anita Justice","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and\/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"James M.

Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. Methodology\/Principal Findings This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far. Conclusions\/Significance This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elco van Burg","author_inst":"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Wijnanda van Burg-Verhage","author_inst":"Lentera Papua"},{"author_name":"David Scannali","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Alicja Nazgiewicz","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Prestes","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Maier","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre- and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and it is then deployed to explore partial relaxations. The results indicate that the different countries have been successful in reducing the reproductive number to values ranging from 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64 - 0.70) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 - 0.95). Results also suggest that a relaxation of 25% could halt the decline in cases in all five countries, while a 50% relaxation could lead to second peaks that are higher and last longer than the earlier peaks in each country. Even though the relaxations so far may have preserved the success of the lockdowns, vigilance is still needed. A relaxation of around 10-15% is recommended if COVID-19 is to continue to decline in all five countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David H Glass","author_inst":"Ulster University"},{"author_name":"Wijnanda van Burg-Verhage","author_inst":"Lentera Papua"},{"author_name":"David Scannali","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Alicja Nazgiewicz","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Prestes","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Maier","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

Here, we evaluated a pooling method to determine if this could improve screening efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining accuracy in Guangzhou, China. Methods We evaluated 8097 throat swap samples collected from individuals who came for a health check-up or fever clinic in The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University between March 4, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Samples were screened for CoViD-19 infection using the WHO-approved quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) primers. The positive samples were classified into two groups (high or low) based on viral load in accordance with the CT value of COVID-19 RT-qPCR results. Each positive RNA samples were mixed with COVID-19 negative RNA or ddH2O to form RNA pools. Findings Samples with high viral load could be detected in pool negative samples (up to 1\/1000 dilution fold). In contrast, the detection of RNA sample from positive patients with low viral load in a pool was difficult and not repeatable. Interpretation Our results show that the COVID-19 viral load significantly influences in pooling efficacy. COVID-19 has distinct viral load profile which depends on the timeline of infection. Thus, application of pooling for infection surveillance may lead to false negatives and hamper infection control efforts.

Our study evaluates the performance of a tailor-designed deep convolutional network on the tasks of early detection and localization of radiological signs associated to COVID-19 on frontal chest X-rays. We also asses the frameworks capacity in differentiating the above-mentioned signs, which are usually confused with the more usual common bacterial and viral pneumonias. Open-source chest X-ray images categorized as Normal, Non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonias were downloaded from the NIH (n=2,259), RSNA (n=600) and HM Hospitales (n=2,307). Our algorithmic framework was able to precisely detect the images with COVID19- related radiological findings (mean Accuracy: 90.5%; Sensitivity: 80.6%; Specificity: 98.0%), whilst correctly categorizing images deemed as Non-COVID-19 pneumonias (mean Accuracy: 88.4%; Sensitivity: 93.3%; Specificity: 92.0%) and normal chest X- rays (mean Accuracy 92.1%; Sensitivity: 91.8%; Specificity: 94.3%). The associated results show that our AI framework is able to classify COVID-19 accurately, making of it a potential tool to improve the diagnostic performance across primary-care centres and, to grant priority to a subset of algorithmic selected images for urgent follow-on expert review.

Here, we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Chicago, Illinois and assess their relationship to clinical parameters. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from COVID-19 patients in a Chicago healthcare system in mid-March, 2020. Using these and other publicly available sequences, we performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and phylodynamic analyses. Patient data was assessed for correlations between demographic or clinical characteristics and virologic features. Findings The 88 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in our study separated into three distinct phylogenetic clades. Clade 1 was most closely related to viral sequences from New York, and showed evidence of rapid expansion across the US, while Clade 3 was most closely related to those in Washington state. Clade 2 was localized primarily to the Chicago area with limited evidence of expansion elsewhere. At the time of diagnosis, patients infected with Clade 1 viruses had significantly higher average viral loads in their upper airways relative to patients infected with Clade 2 viruses, independent of time to symptom onset and disease severity. Interpretation These results show that multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in the Chicago area that differ in their relative viral loads in patient upper airways. These data suggest that differences in virus genotype impact viral load and may in turn influence viral transmission and spread.

Methods and analysis: We describe the rationale and design of an open-label pragmatic multicentre randomised (concealed) clinical trial of 7 days of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID) plus azithromycin (500 mg once daily), hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID, or standard of care for moderately severe hospitalised patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (in-patients with up to 4L\/minute oxygen supply through nasal catheter). Patients are randomised in around 50 recruiting sites and we plan to enrol 630 patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint is a 7-level ordinal scale measured at 15-days: 1)not hospitalised, without limitations on activities; 2)not hospitalised, with limitations on activities; 3)hospitalised, not using supplementary oxygen; 4)hospitalised, using supplementary oxygen; 5)hospitalised, using high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation; 6)hospitalised, on mechanical ventilation; 7)death. Secondary endpoints are the ordinal scale at 7 days, need for mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies during 15 days, need of high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation during 15 days, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, thromboembolic events, occurrence of acute kidney injury, and number of days free of respiratory support at 15 days. Secondary safety outcomes include prolongation of QT interval on electrocardiogram, ventricular arrhythmias, and liver toxicity. The main analysis will consider all patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the groups they were randomly assigned. Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by Brazil's National Ethic Committee (CONEP) and National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). An independent data monitoring committee will perform interim analyses and evaluate adverse events throughout the trial. Results will be submitted for publication after enrolment and follow-up are complete, as well as presented and reported to local health agencies.

Our objective was to systematically evaluate their efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Medrxviv for studies of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 hospitalized patients on April 26, 2020. We evaluated the quality of trials and observational studies using the Jadad criteria and Newcastle Ottawa Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After a review of 175 citations, we included 5 clinical trials (total of 345 patients), 9 observational studies (n = 2529), and 6 additional studies (n = 775) reporting on the QT interval. Three studies reported treatment benefits including two studies reporting benefit on virologic outcomes, which was statistically significant in one study, and another reported significant improvement on cough symptoms. Three studies reported that treatment was potentially harmful, including an significantly increased risk of mortality in two studies and increased need for respiratory support in another. Eight studies were unable to detect improvements on virologic outcomes (n = 3) or pneumonia or transfer to ICU\/death (n = 5). The proportion of participants with critical QTc intervals of [&ge;] 500 ms or an increase of [&ge;] 60 ms from baseline ranged from 8.3% to 36% (n = 8). One clinical trial and six observational studies were of good quality. The remaining studies were of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review of reported clinical studies did not identify substantial evidence to support the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and raises questions about potential harm from QT prolongation and increased mortality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonal Singh","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Meyers Primary Care Institute and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical School, "},{"author_name":"Thomas J Moore","author_inst":"Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA  and  Department of Epidemiology, The George Washi"},{"author_name":"Luciani CP Azevedo","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio Libanes Research and Education Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Regis G Rosa","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre,Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Avezum","author_inst":"Hospital Alemao Oswaldo Cruz, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Viviane C Veiga","author_inst":"BP - A Beneficencia Portuguesa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renato D Lopes","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center - Duke Clinical Research Institute - Durham, North Carolina, USA."},{"author_name":"Leticia Kawano-Dourado","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lucas P Damiani","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriano J Pereira","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ary Serpa Neto","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Remo Furtado","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Bruno Tomazini","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio Libanes Research and Education Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Israel S Maia","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Maicon Falavigna","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thiago C Lisboa","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Henrique Fonseca","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Flavia R Machado","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Otavio Berwanger","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"COALITION COVID-19 Brazil I Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Pawel Bogdanski","author_inst":"Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland"},{"author_name":"Bernard Keavney","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew P.

High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients ([&ge;]65 years) who received HFNC from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, People's Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, People's Hospital of Yangjiang City, People's Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China. Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2\/FiO2 [&le;] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2\/FiO2 [&le;] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liehua Deng","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine of affiliated hospital of Guangdong Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shaoqing Lei","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"David A.

We aimed to explore the association of RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. Methods: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library were searched for the period of January 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Studies reporting the association of RAAS inhibitors (ACEi and ARBs) and mortality in patients with hypertension, hospitalized for COVID-19 were extracted. Two reviewers independently extracted appropriate data of interest and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Results: Data were collected on 2,065,805 individuals (mean age, 58.73 years; 53.4% male). Patients with hypertension taking RAAS inhibitors were 35% less likely to die from COVID-19 compared to patients with hypertension not taking RAAS inhibitors (pooled RR= 0.65, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 0.45-0.94). To explore the association of COVID-19 and specific classes of RAAS inhibitors, we conducted a subgroup analysis of ARBs and ACEi separately from studies that provided them. Pooled risk ratio estimates from ARBs and ACEi showed a lower but not significant risk of death from COVID-19 (RR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.70-1.22) and ACEi (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.30). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, it was discovered that taking RAAS inhibitors, significantly decreased the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with hypertension. This indicates a potential protective role that RAAS-inhibitors may have in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Ssentongo","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Paddy Ssentongo","author_inst":"Penn State University"},{"author_name":"Emily S.

A particularly unstable federal regime and fragile socioeconomic situation is likely to have contributed to the impact of the disease. Amid this crisis there is substantial concern in the possible socioeconomic, geopolitical and ethnic inequity of the impact of COVID-19 on the country's particularly diverse population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using observational data from the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We present descriptive statistics to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. We assess the importance of regional factors such as education, income and health either on a state-by-state basis or by splitting Brazil into a North and a Central-South region. Mixed-effects survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. Findings: Our results show that, compared to branco comparators, hospitalised pardo and preto Brazilians have significantly higher risk of mortality, with hazard ratios and 95% CI of 1.47 (1.33-1.58) and 1.32 (1.15-1.52), respectively. In particular, pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age). We also found that hospitalised Brazilians in North regions tend to have more comorbidities than in the Central-South, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. Finally, we found that states in the North have a higher hazard ratio as compared to the Central-South, and that Rio de Janeiro obtained one of the highest hazard ratios, similar to the ones of the more underdeveloped Pernambuco and Amazonas. Interpretation: Our results can be interpreted according to the interplay of two independent, but correlated, effects: i) mortality by COVID-19 increases going North (vertical effect), ii) mortality increases for the pardo and preto population (horizontal effect). We speculate that the vertical effect is driven by increasing levels of comorbidity in Northern regions where levels of socioeconomic development are lower, whereas the horizontal effect may be related to lower levels of healthcare access or availability (including intensive care) for pardo and preto Brazilians. For most states the vertical and horizontal effects are correlated giving a larger cumulative mortality. However, Rio de Janeiro was found to be an outlier to this trend: It has an ethnicity composition (horizontal effect) similar to the states in the North region, despite high levels of socioeconomic development (vertical effect). Our analysis motivates an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect pardo and preto Brazilians as well as the population of poorer states from their higher death risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Otavio Baqui","author_inst":"Federal University of Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ioana Bica","author_inst":"University of Oxford; The Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Valerio Marra","author_inst":"Federal University of Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ari Ercole","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Mihaela Van Der Schaar","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Cambridge; University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chigozie A.

In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis after the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID- 19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junaid Shuja","author_inst":"Umm Al-Qura University"},{"author_name":"Eisa Alanazi","author_inst":"Umm Al-Qura University"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alasmary","author_inst":"Umm Al-Qura University"},{"author_name":"Abdulaziz Alashaikh","author_inst":"University of Jeddah"},{"author_name":"Ruben Abagyan","author_inst":"Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States"},{"author_name":"Chigozie A.

Some interventions used to give oxygen therapy are aerosol generating procedures. Staff delivering such interventions require PPE and are exposed to a significant viral load resulting in sick days and even death. We aim to reduce this risk using an augmented-reality communication device: The HoloLens by Microsoft. OBJECTIVES: In a tertiary centre in London we aim to implement HoloLens technology, allowing other medical staff to remotely join the consulting clinician when in a high-risk patient area delivering oxygen therapy. The study primary outcome was to reduce the exposure to staff and demonstrate non-inferiority staff satisfaction when compared to not using the device. Our secondary outcome was to reduce extrapolated PPE costs when using the device. METHODS: Our study was conducted in March and April 2020, within a respiratory unit delivering aerosolising oxygen therapies (High flow nasal oxygen, Continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation) to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported questionnaires to assess satisfaction in key areas of patient care. An infrared people counting device was also used to assess staff in and out of the unit. MAIN RESULTS: Mean self-reported time in the high-risk zone was less when using HoloLens (2.69 hours) compared to usual practice (3.96 hours) although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3657). HoloLens showed non-inferiority when compared to usual practice in staff satisfaction score for all domains. Furthermore, mean staff satisfaction score encouragingly improved when using HoloLens. Self-reported PPE counts from this study showed 12 staff members changing PPE 25.8 times per shift, almost double the 13.5 times in the HoloLens count. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated HoloLens can reduce the number of staff exposed to aerosol generating areas in a novel infectious disease. Our results show it did not impair communication, medical staff availability or end of life care. HoloLens technology may also reduce the use of PPE, which has equipment availability and cost benefits. This study provides grounding for further use of the HoloLens device by bringing a bedside experience to experts remote to the situation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John J Cafferkey","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dominic OP Hampson","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Clare Ross","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Angad S Kooner","author_inst":"Cutrale Perioperative and Ageing Research Group, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy FJ Martin","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"James M Kinross","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Margaret R.

We reviewed neurological manifestations due to the new coronavirus, thus far published in the literature, as well as guidelines issued by sub-specialties in Neurology, to tackle the disease. Methods: we searched medical databases, such as PubMed, PubMed Central, LILACS and Google scholar for papers (case reports, short letters, case series, etc) describing neurological symptoms in patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 diagnosis and also searched webpages of associations and organizations that deal with neurological disorders. Results: we describe briefly each article considered for this review. Forty-one papers were found associating neurological conditions and COVID-19. Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo Afonso Mei","author_inst":"S\u00e3o Leopoldo Mandic College"},{"author_name":"Laura Loeb","author_inst":"S\u00e3o Leopoldo Mandic College"},{"author_name":"Clare Ross","author_inst":"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London UK"},{"author_name":"Angad S Kooner","author_inst":"Cutrale Perioperative and Ageing Research Group, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy FJ Martin","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"James M Kinross","author_inst":"Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London UK"},{"author_name":"Margaret R.
