However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; -HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission ([&ge;] 6.126 pg\/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg\/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and -HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and -HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and -HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chaomin Wu","author_inst":"QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xianglin Hu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Song","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunling Du","author_inst":"QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Fengxian Guhua Hospital, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Dechang Chen","author_inst":"Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Ming Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Weining Xiong","author_inst":"Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ke Lang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuye Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Guohua Shi","author_inst":"Qingpu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shanghai,"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Gongli Hospital, Pudong New Area, Shanghai,"},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Song","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine in Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ming Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Junhua Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, School of Medicine in Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.20027557","rel_title":"Therapeutic effects of dipyridamole on COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.20027557","rel_abs":"The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Li","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shuai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University; Dawu County People's Hospital, Xiaogan City;"},{"author_name":"Zhanghua Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University; Bi"},{"author_name":"Zhiyao Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi-you Huang","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qingling Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinyi Shi","author_inst":"Dawu County People's Hospital, Xiaogan City"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Xu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Huifang Xian","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rongli Fang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20027615","rel_title":"Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20027615","rel_abs":"Before the lock-down of Wuhan\/Hubei\/China, on January 23rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine\/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanyi Tang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Biao Tang","author_inst":"York University, Canada"},{"author_name":"Nicola Luigi Bragazzi","author_inst":"York Unversity, Canada"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Tangjuan Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Pengyu Ren","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Zhihang Peng","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanni Xiao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University, Canada"},{"author_name":"Huifang Xian","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rongli Fang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028472","rel_title":"The Effects of \"Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan\" Makeshift Hospitals and Temperature on the Mortality of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028472","rel_abs":"Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear. Methods Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis. Results The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012). Conclusions Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuwen Cai","author_inst":"Grade 2016, the Second Clinical Medical College of Nanchang University, Jiangxi, China"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Huang Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China"},{"author_name":"Gaosi Xu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China"},{"author_name":"Tangjuan Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Pengyu Ren","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Zhihang Peng","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanni Xiao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University, Canada"},{"author_name":"Huifang Xian","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rongli Fang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028373","rel_title":"Rapid Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Virus RNA Using Colorimetric LAMP","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028373","rel_abs":"The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting.

Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection.

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P>0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g\/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"dong chen Jr.","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Diseases, Wenzhou Central Hospital and Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaokuni Li","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"qifa song Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Ningbo Municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, Zhej"},{"author_name":"Chenchan Hu Jr.","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital and Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Feifei Su","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital and Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jianyi Dai","author_inst":"Wenzhou Central Hospital and Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal Univerity"},{"author_name":"Zhihang Peng","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanni Xiao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University, Canada"},{"author_name":"Huifang Xian","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rongli Fang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028449","rel_title":"Modelling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship using the public surveillance data from January 20 to February 20, 2020","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028449","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020.

The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Zhao","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peihua Cao","author_inst":"Southern Midical University"},{"author_name":"Daozhou Gao","author_inst":"Shanghai Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zian Zhuang","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Marc Chong","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yongli Cai","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Ran","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Lou","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20024398","rel_title":"Highland of COVID-19 outside Hubei: epidemic characteristics, control and projections of Wenzhou, China","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20024398","rel_abs":"In late December 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China.

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed\/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older([&ge;]8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Xu","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sufang Huang","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shangkun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juan Deng","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Jiao","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ling Ai","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yaru Xiao","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Li Yan","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.24.20027474","rel_title":"Estimate the incubation period of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.24.20027474","rel_abs":"Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age\/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Henry Han","author_inst":"Fordham University"},{"author_name":"Sufang Huang","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shangkun Liu","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Juan Deng","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Jiao","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ling Ai","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yaru Xiao","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Li Yan","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weiming Wang","author_inst":"Huaiyin Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yang","author_inst":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Daihai He","author_inst":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Maggie H Wang","author_inst":"Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), School of Life Sciences, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Changxing Ou","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Bei Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Lew","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jun Cui","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Huang","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Department, The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzho"},{"author_name":"Xuechuan Hong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Science, Innovation Center for Traditional Tibetan Medicine Modernization and Quality Control, Medical College, Tib"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fulin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Luo","author_inst":"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.967885","rel_title":"Prediction of receptorome for human-infecting virome","rel_date":"2020-02-28","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.967885","rel_abs":"The virus receptors are key for the viral infection of host cells.

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome\/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of >5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of >500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (>10 pg\/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bicheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Zhou","author_inst":"Cardiac Care Unit, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yanru Qiu","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fan Feng","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jia Feng","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yifan Jia","author_inst":"Department of Pain Management, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hengcheng Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Urology Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ke Hu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shouyi Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiasheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zaiming Liu","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shihong Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yiping Gong","author_inst":"Department of Breast, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ting Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yanxiang Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Liu","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hongping Deng","author_inst":"Department of Vascular Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Tao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Ren","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Biheng Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Gao","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiongfei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Vasculocardiology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Huang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhangfan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028225","rel_title":"Clinical features and sexual transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infected female patients: a descriptive study in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028225","rel_abs":"Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pengfei

In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific\/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Conclusion: Given our results, the public health\/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SarahAnn M McFadden","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Amyn A Malik","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Obianuju G Aguolu","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Kathryn S Willebrand","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Ting Ding","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Cong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Shan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yueguang Rong","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Miao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Shixuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Hongping Deng","author_inst":"Department of Vascular Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Tao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Ren","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Biheng Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Gao","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiongfei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Vasculocardiology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Huang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhangfan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20027672","rel_title":"Illness and Fatality Risks of COVID-19 of General Public in Hubei Provinces and Other Parts of China","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20027672","rel_abs":"New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 poses a big challenge for global public health in early 2020.

It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongdou Li","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Wang","author_inst":"Guanghan Research Center of Personalized Healthcare, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhong","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wuyin Bao","author_inst":"Guanghan Research Center of Personalized Healthcare, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yipeng Li","author_inst":"Guanghan Research Center of Personalized Healthcare, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Wang","author_inst":"Obstetrics Gynecology Hospital, The Institute of Reproduction and Developmental Biology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yungang He","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Shan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yueguang Rong","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Miao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Shixuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Hongping Deng","author_inst":"Department of Vascular Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Tao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Ren","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Biheng Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Gao","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiongfei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Vasculocardiology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Huang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhangfan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028167","rel_title":"Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028167","rel_abs":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries.

The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhong","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wuyin Bao","author_inst":"Guanghan Research Center of Personalized Healthcare, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yipeng Li","author_inst":"Guanghan Research Center of Personalized Healthcare, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Wang","author_inst":"Obstetrics Gynecology Hospital, The Institute of Reproduction and Developmental Biology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yungang He","author_inst":"Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Wanying Shan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Yueguang Rong","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Miao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Shixuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Hongping Deng","author_inst":"Department of Vascular Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Tao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Ren","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Biheng Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Gao","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiongfei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Vasculocardiology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Huang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhangfan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20028043","rel_title":"Clinical Data on Hospital Environmental Hygiene Monitoring and Medical Staffs Protection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20028043","rel_abs":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection.

Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21\/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P<0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19x10^9\/L ({+\/-}1.47) versus 7.21x10^9\/L ({+\/-}2.94), P<0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39x10^9\/L ({+\/-}1.48) versus 5.38x10^9\/L ({+\/-}2.85), P<0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Liang","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingjin Liang","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingtao Zhou","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguang Li","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Lin","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhonghua Deng","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Biying Zhang","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Wang","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhu","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingbian Ma","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Tong","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongchang Sun","author_inst":"Peking University Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Shixuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."},{"author_name":"Hongping Deng","author_inst":"Department of Vascular Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fenghua Tao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijun Ren","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Biheng Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Gao","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiongfei Wu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Department of Vasculocardiology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Huang","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhangfan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qibin Song","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Eastern Campus, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Cancer, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20027664","rel_title":"Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20027664","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province\/autonomous regions\/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Conclusion: Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei-jie Guan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health"},{"author_name":"Wen-hua Liang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Yi Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Heng-rui Liang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zi-sheng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Xiao-qing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Ru-chong Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Chun-li Tang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Chun-quan Ou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ping-yan Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ling Sang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Jian-fu Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Cai-chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Li-min Ou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Bo Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Shan Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that Rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of Rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Heng-rui Liang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zi-sheng Chen","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Xiao-qing Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Ru-chong Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Chun-li Tang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical Univ"},{"author_name":"Chun-quan Ou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ping-yan Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ling Sang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Jian-fu Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Cai-chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Li-min Ou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Bo Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Shan Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. ResultsSignificantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P<0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P<0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P<0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P<0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P<0.001), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) (R=-0.322, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P<0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P<0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P<0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P<0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P<0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01). ConclusionWith following parameters such as age >67.5 years, IL2R >793.5U\/mL, CRP >30.7ng\/mL, ferroprotein >2252g\/L, WBC>9.5*10^9\/L or NC >7.305*10^9\/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented.

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79\/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%68\/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75\/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20\/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35\/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University."},{"author_name":"Xiaoshuai Ren","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowang Guo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaqin Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chaoqun Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianhui Zhou","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ping-yan Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ling Sang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Jian-fu Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Cai-chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Li-min Ou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Bo Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Shan Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Hui","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yingqian Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Bingxi He","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Tian","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yundai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ping-yan Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ling Sang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Jian-fu Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Cai-chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Li-min Ou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Bo Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Shan Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir\/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir\/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenyu Fan","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yajun Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shaoping Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhanju Liu","author_inst":"The Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Jilin Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yundai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ping-yan Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, Department of Biostatistics, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public "},{"author_name":"Ling Sang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseas"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Jian-fu Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Cai-chen Li","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Li-min Ou","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Bo Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Shan Xiong","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Oncology and Surgery, China State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease & National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, the "},{"author_name":"Zheng-yi Ni","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Songmin Ying","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinwei Geng","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xufei Du","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haixia Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sisi Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhehua Shao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinfang Wu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly\/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kin Kit Li","author_inst":"The City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ho Hin Chan","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Arthur Tang","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhehua Shao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinfang Wu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jin-yin-tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital;

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein.
