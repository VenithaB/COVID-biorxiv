MethodsIn this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF- and INF-{gamma}, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF- was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Qi","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xumao Tang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Junnan Peng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Yu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Longhua Feng","author_inst":"Qianjiang Central Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Guodan Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"An Zhang","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Zhang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China; Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Song","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Chunfang Qian","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qiangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Tong","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20027797","rel_title":"Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID-19 by the Kermack-McKendrick model","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20027797","rel_abs":"In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID[-]19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ru Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Ming","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Chi"},{"author_name":"Ou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jianli Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Peng","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China"},{"author_name":"Ning Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Allergy, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Pro"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhu","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Chi"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Zhang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China; Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Song","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Chunfang Qian","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qiangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Tong","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.28.20029199","rel_title":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Medical Treatment of Chinese Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\uff1aA Multicenter Cross-section Study in the Context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.28.20029199","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medical advice seeking of Chinese children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaofu Zhang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Haiping Yang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zhang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing. 210008, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Shen","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital,  Chengdu, 611731, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijuan Li","author_inst":"Xi'an children's Hospital, Xi'an, 710003, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhong Li","author_inst":"Guiyang children's Hospital, Guiyang, 550003, China"},{"author_name":"Lijun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanxi children's Hospital, Taiyuan, 300013, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Du","author_inst":"Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110004, China"},{"author_name":"Liangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhao","author_inst":"Kunming children's Hospital, Kunming, 650000, China"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830000, China"},{"author_name":"Haidong Fu","author_inst":"The Children Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310053, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South  University, Changsha 410011, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojie Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen children's hospital, Shenzhen,518038, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng Hao","author_inst":"Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200062, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Ding","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, 430016, China"},{"author_name":"Zongwen Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiquan Xu","author_inst":"Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center,  Haikou , 570300, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaorong Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China"},{"author_name":"Daoqi Wu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Mingsi Gao","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Mo Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qiu Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029074","rel_title":"Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029074","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate. The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria drug (atovaquone; TI >34), an inhalable corticosteroid (ciclesonide; TI >6), etc. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of coronavirus-related illnesses, including the currently emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meehyun Ko","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"So Young Chang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Soo Young Byun","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Inhee Choi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"David Shum","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Ji-Young Min","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Marc P.

This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-{gamma} inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir ul Qamar","author_inst":"Guangxi University, Nanning, P.

Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses.\n\nResultsSystematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.\n\nConclusionsOur studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV.

Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection.

To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN\/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding sites conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Bzowka","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Karolina Mitusinska","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Agata Raczynska","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Samol","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jack Adam Tuszynski","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton"},{"author_name":"Artur Gora","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Adam Lesner","author_inst":"Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Ochman","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Maciej Urlik","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Jan Potempa","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Kantyka","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyrc","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.965418","rel_title":"The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.965418","rel_abs":"In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host.

Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes.

Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal\/mole and -786.0 Kcal\/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also.

Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulphate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide.

Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+\/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haiyan Fu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Hongjuan Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Tang","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Jie Shen","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yujun Zhou","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Bing Xu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.20028027","rel_title":"Prediction of survival for severe Covid-19 patients with three clinical features: development of a machine learning-based prognostic model with clinical data in Wuhan","rel_date":"2020-03-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.20028027","rel_abs":"The sudden increase of COVID-19 cases is putting a high pressure on healthcare services worldwide.

To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haiyan Fu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Hongjuan Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Tang","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Jie Shen","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yujun Zhou","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Bing Xu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.20028787","rel_title":"Evaluation of Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay and Colloidal Gold- Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for Detection of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) Causing an Outbreak of Pneumonia (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-03-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.20028787","rel_abs":"Abstract BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55\/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75\/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Mingzhe Yan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Hongze Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Ting Liu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Chenyao Lin","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Huang","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Changxin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028431","rel_title":"Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data","rel_date":"2020-03-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028431","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U\/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg\/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng\/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg\/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Huang","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Rui Yang","author_inst":"Department of Vascular surgery, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Ying Xu","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Ping Gong","author_inst":"Physical Examination Center, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Junling Ma","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Shuang Huang","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Changxin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028571","rel_title":"Infection Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)Modeled with the Integration of the Eyring Rate ProcessTheory and Free Volume Concept","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028571","rel_abs":"The Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, two very popular theories in chemistry and physics fields, are employed to treat infectious disease transmissions.

The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R>1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei.

Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Jinmei Zhang","author_inst":"Xiguan Community Health Center of Liangzhou"},{"author_name":"Menglan Cao","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Cang Hui","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shuang Huang","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Changxin Shen","author_inst":"Department of Blood Transfusion, ZhongNan hospital of Wuhan University, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.20027524","rel_title":"Sex differences in clinical findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe condition","rel_date":"2020-02-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.20027524","rel_abs":"Objective: To compare the sex differences in the clinical findings among patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng\/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital. Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type. Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse in-hospital outcomes as compared to women.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Yinghua Zhang","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, Beijing 100053, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Wang","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Liu","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Guodong Tang","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Chang","author_inst":"Division of Intensive Care Unit, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Aihua Liu","author_inst":"Division of Rheumatology and Immunology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Chunyi Fu","author_inst":"Division of Emergency, Beijing Hospital, Beijing 100730, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Gao","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, Beijing 100053, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Division of Cardiology, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, Beijing 100053, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"}]}
