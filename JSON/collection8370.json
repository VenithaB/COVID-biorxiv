Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, RC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining the effective reproduction number RCeff{approx}Rc S\/N at approximately 1.0. The objectives of the full sequence of measures observed in a number of countries, and likely to be seen in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: R0 [-&gt;] RC<R0 [-&gt;] RC<1.0 [-&gt;] RCeff{approx}1.0. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including misconceptions about 'flattening the curve' and how the herd immunity concept can be used to 'leverage' immunity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael E.

This survey observes that most countries undergo a beginning exponential growth phase, which transitions into a power-law phase, as recently suggested by Ziff and Ziff. Tracking indicators of growth, such as the power-law exponent, are a good indication of the relative danger different countries are in and show when social measures are effective towards slowing the spread. The data compiled here are usefully synthesizing a global picture, identifying country to country variation in spreading, and identifying countries most at risk. This analysis may factor into how best to track the effectiveness of social distancing policies and quarantines in real-time as data is updated each day.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack Merrin","author_inst":"IST Austria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20048397","rel_title":"Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality","rel_date":"2020-04-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20048397","rel_abs":"The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9 and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Dudel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Tim Riffe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Enrique Acosta","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Alyson A. van Raalte","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Cosmo Strozza","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20048967","rel_title":"Knowledge and behaviors toward COVID-19 among U.S. residents during the early days of the pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20048967","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective: To test the hypothesis that knowledge of COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020. Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively.

Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity\/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Elvezia Maria Paraboschi","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mantovani","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Duga","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Cosmo Strozza","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.20048439","rel_title":"Research on the Influence of Information Diffusion on the Transmission of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-04-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.20048439","rel_abs":"With the rapid development of mobile Internet in China, the information of the epidemic is full-time and holographic, and the role of information diffusion in epidemic control is increasingly prominent.

Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars towards achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases\/day) and growth acceleration (cases\/day^2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay) and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at http:\/\/www.theguarani.com.br\/covid-19 or downloaded from https:\/\/github.com\/adamtaiti\/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 853,200 cases reported worldwide as of April 2nd 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within few days, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuri Tani Utsunomiya","author_inst":"Department of Support, Production and Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine of Aracatuba, Sao Paulo State University (Unesp), 16050-680 R.

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The peak is expected by March 29th at national level.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"COSIMO DISTANTE","author_inst":"CNR ISASI, Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligence Systems, Lecce, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Euro Mediterranean Scientific Biomedical Institute (ISBEM), Bruxelles, Belgium"},{"author_name":"ALESSANDRO MIANI","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvana Cassia Paulan","author_inst":"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Collaborating Centre on Animal Genomics and Bioinformatics, 16050-680 R.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns\/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Chiara","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"David Stephen Horner","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Graziano Pesole","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Silvana Cassia Paulan","author_inst":"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Collaborating Centre on Animal Genomics and Bioinformatics, 16050-680 R.

For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1\/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Runyu Yuan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Li","author_inst":"The Third Affilated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huifang Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jingju Peng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Qianlin Xiong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jiufeng Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ruben J.G.

We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-[Kcy]B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8\/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients.

We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We then observed that the ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues.

Overall results revealed that, SARS-CoV-2 codon usage is slightly biased similarly to other RNA viruses. Nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions displayed a bias toward A\/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Eight common putative preferred codons were identified, and all of them were A\/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). In addition, natural selection was found to be the main force structuring the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. However, mutation pressure and other factors such as compositional constraints and hydrophobicity had an undeniable contribution. Two adaptation indices were utilized and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is moderately adapted to Homo sapiens compared to other human viruses. The outcome of this study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and may aid in vaccine design strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saif M.

Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to May 9, 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do; this was partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk of death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 25.9% (95% CrI: 19.6%-33.6%), 20.8% (95% CrI: 18.1%-24.0%) in Daegu and 1.7% (95% CrI: 1.1%-2.5%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate was 10.2% (95% CrI: 9.0%-11.5%).

Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Esposito","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Palmisano","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giulia Maria Scotti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Marco Jacopo Morelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Basile Landis","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alan Carleton","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rodriguez","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Joyce Fu","author_inst":"University of California, Riverside"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenshan Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tongyu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047860","rel_title":"Global versus focused isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-A cost-effectiveness analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20047860","rel_abs":"Objectives: While highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, national lockdowns come with an enormous economic price. Few countries have adopted an alternative \"testing, tracing, and isolation\" approach to selectively isolate people at high exposure risk, thereby minimizing the economic impact. To assist policymakers, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of these two strategies. Methods: A modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered and Deceased (SEIRD) model was employed to assess the situation in Israel, a small country with ~9 million people. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of these strategies, as well as the expected number of infected individuals and deaths were calculated. Results: A nationwide lockdown is expected to save on average 274 (median 124, interquartile range (IQR): 71-221) lives compared to the \"testing, tracing, and isolation\" approach. However, the ICER will be on average $45,104,156 (median $ 49.6 million, IQR: 22.7-220.1) to prevent one case of death. Conclusions: A national lockdown has a moderate advantage in saving lives with tremendous costs and possible overwhelming economic effects. These findings should assist decision-makers in dealing with additional waves of this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Shlomai","author_inst":"Department of Medicine D and The Liver Institute, Rabin Medical Center,  Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva, Israel and The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv U"},{"author_name":"Ari Leshno","author_inst":"Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel and The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."},{"author_name":"Ella H Sklan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Moshe Leshno","author_inst":"The Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Basile Landis","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alan Carleton","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rodriguez","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Joyce Fu","author_inst":"University of California, Riverside"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenshan Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tongyu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047456","rel_title":"Classification of COVID-19 in chest X-ray images using DeTraC deep convolutional neural network","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.20047456","rel_abs":"Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification. However, due to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism. The experimental results showed the capability of DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 cases from a comprehensive image dataset collected from several hospitals around the world. High accuracy of 95.12% (with a sensitivity of 97.91%, a specificity of 91.87%, and a precision of 93.36%) was achieved by DeTraC in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal, and severe acute respiratory syndrome cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asmaa Abbas","author_inst":"Assiut University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Abdelsamea","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Gaber","author_inst":"Birmingham City University"},{"author_name":"Moshe Leshno","author_inst":"The Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Davide Vignale","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Cobelli","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Tonon","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tacchetti","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"},{"author_name":"Basile Landis","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Alan Carleton","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rodriguez","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Joyce Fu","author_inst":"University of California, Riverside"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenshan Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tongyu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046243","rel_title":"The COVID-19 infection in Italy: a statistical study of an abnormally severe disease","rel_date":"2020-04-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046243","rel_abs":"We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is particularly invasive in Italy.

To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19, we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a good representation of a laboratory case-study from an isolated system in which all the people have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal seriousness of the disease in Italy.

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcia C Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

The number of travelers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Methods: We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning, or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2007 to 2016. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel, and the association between a state's FSI score and air travel. Results: Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of passengers increased from 0.791 billion to 1.28 billion between 2007 and 2016. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The greatest increase was observed for travel to Warning countries from Warning countries, with an annual increase of 8,967,623 passengers (95%CI: 6,546,494 to 11,388,753) over the study period. Conclusions: The world's connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh R Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Deepit Bhatia","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Rahim Moineddin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccolo","author_inst":"CoronaVerus, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Dept.

We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+\/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+\/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found. Conclussions: Our proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be useful to evaluate early characteristics of this outbreak.

In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar Patterson-Lomba","author_inst":"Analysis Group"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier de Cos Juez","author_inst":"Universidad de Oviedo"},{"author_name":"Rahim Moineddin","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Isaac Bogoch","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Wanderson Kleber de Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccolo","author_inst":"CoronaVerus, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli \"Federico II\", Dept.

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years. In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reza S.
