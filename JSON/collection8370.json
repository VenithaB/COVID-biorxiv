The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Shao","author_inst":"Xi'an Polytechnic University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.993097","rel_title":"Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.993097","rel_abs":"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has important implications in vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huibin Lv","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, {tau}, and two rate parameters: contact rate, r_E, and exclusion rate, r_E. The rates can be manipulated by non-therapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R = r_C\/r_E, and, together with {tau}, the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, {beta}. Initial {beta} determines the reduction of r_C required to contain epidemic spread. In the long-term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which r_C first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self-isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marek Kochanczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Frederic Grabowski","author_inst":"University of Warsaw"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Lipniacki","author_inst":"Institute of Fundamental Technological Research"},{"author_name":"Meng Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ranawaka A.

Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 [A]. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the \"closed\" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \"open\" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSHigh resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).\n\nRecognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.\n\nStructure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.\n\nIdentification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yun Qiu","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wei Shi","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Misook Choe","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Hongjun Bai","author_inst":"MHRP, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Agnes Hajduczki","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Lianying Yan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer L Sterling","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Peterson","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Furthermore, RaTGl3 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTGl3 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiao-Mei Huang","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Syed Sajid Jan","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobin Wei","author_inst":"Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Agnes Hajduczki","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Lianying Yan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer L Sterling","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Peterson","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The viral spike protein S binds ACE2 on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2 are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this unprecedented challenge.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik Procko","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Carla Caponi","author_inst":"Clinica Geriatrica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\\\\Piazzale Gambuli 1, 06132, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Vittorio De Socio","author_inst":"Clinica Malattie Infettive, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria\\\\Piazzale Gambuli 1, 06132, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Agnes Hajduczki","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Lianying Yan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer L Sterling","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Peterson","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA - based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muserref Duygu Sacar Demirci","author_inst":"Abdullah Gul University"},{"author_name":"Aysun Adan","author_inst":"Abdullah Gul University"},{"author_name":"Hubert Gallee","author_inst":"IGE UGA-CNRS"},{"author_name":"Yi Wan","author_inst":"Hainan University"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Agnes Hajduczki","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Lianying Yan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Spencer L Sterling","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Peterson","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an \"easy-to-use\" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period {tau} = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures.

The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients. Results: 1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 2. Excellent therapeutic effectAmong 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital. Conclusions: In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in epidemic situation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhonghe Li","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Qu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaobin Zheng","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Changli Tu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Meizhu Chen","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cuiyan Tan","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yan-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ethan C Green","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Clayton Smith","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Natalia de Val","author_inst":"Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI)"},{"author_name":"Mihret Amare","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Paul Scott","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Eric D Laing","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Christopher C Broder","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA, Bethesda, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bing Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chao Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ran Gao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Wei","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ting Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Antibiotics, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qisheng Zhang","author_inst":"Sino Organoid Lifesciences Ltd."},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Junbo Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nuclear acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days after onset), and late-stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the consistencies of whole blood samples with plasma were 100% and 97.1% in IgM and IgG strips, respectively. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunbao Pan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinran Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Gui Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Junli Fan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yueting Tang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghua Long","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Guo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ziwu Zhao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinjuan Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hanning Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Han Xue","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Junbo Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Lin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Morgane Rolland","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Nelson L Michael","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Kayvon Modjarrad","author_inst":"Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Haitao Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijie Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Wenqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Luke W.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes.

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zaixing Shi","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"},{"author_name":"Ya Fang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"},{"author_name":"Sander Herfst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Theo Bestebroer","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Mart Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics Xplore"},{"author_name":"Judith van de Brand","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Okba","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Debby Schipper","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Lonneke Leijten","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Ernst Verschoor","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Babs Verstrepen","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Jan Langermans","author_inst":"BPRC"},{"author_name":"Christian Drosten","author_inst":"Charite Universitatsmedizin"},{"author_name":"Martje Fentener van Vlissingen","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20033472","rel_title":"Blood single cell immune profiling reveals the interferon-MAPK pathway mediated adaptive immune response for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.20033472","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear.

The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shikai Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Zha","author_inst":"Hangzhou Dianzi University"},{"author_name":"Ning Wang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiumei Pang","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tongzeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035386","rel_title":"Multi-city modeling of epidemics using spatial networks: Application to 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus in India","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035386","rel_abs":"The ongoing pandemic of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus has made reliable epidemiological modeling an urgent necessity. Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhalchandra S Pujari","author_inst":"Savitribai Phule Pune University"},{"author_name":"Snehal M Shekatkar","author_inst":"Savitribai Phule Pune University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Zha","author_inst":"Hangzhou Dianzi University"},{"author_name":"Ning Wang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qiumei Pang","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tongzeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.13.20035642","rel_title":"Epidemiological Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.13.20035642","rel_abs":"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilin Chen","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Zhong","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Yueyan Ni","author_inst":"Jinling, Hospital, Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lulu Liu","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Zhong","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Xin Su","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Aixin Li","author_inst":"Department of Infection Diseases, Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunfang You","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Zigong First People's Hospital, Zigong, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Long","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Mianyang No. 404 Hospital, Mianyang, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Zeng","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mei Luo","author_inst":"Infectious diseases laboratory, Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanwei Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Fanxin Zeng","author_inst":"Sichuan Dazhou Central Hosptical, Dazhou, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqiang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Xingxiang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infection Disease, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhenglin Yang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory for Human Disease Gene Study of Sichuan Province and the Center of Laboratory Medicine, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of E"},{"author_name":"Ron Fouchier","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Rik L. de Swart","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Taiqing Feng","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Honglong Wu","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanping Gong","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Zhang","author_inst":"MGI, BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.14.20035741","rel_title":"Excess cases of Influenza like illnesses in France synchronous with COVID19 invasion.","rel_date":"2020-03-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.14.20035741","rel_abs":"Several French regions where COVID19 has been reported currently show a renewed increase in ILI cases in the general practice based Sentinelles network.
