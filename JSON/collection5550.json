The common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, dry cough, fever, and in some patients, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. 312,009 deaths from COVID-19 has been reported as of today. While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic. The intuitive design of this device along with the use of primarily 3D printed or readily available components allow the rapid manufacturing and transportation of this ventilation device to the impacted regions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Faryami","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Carolyn A Harris","author_inst":"Wayne State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.109637","rel_title":"Electric-field-driven microfluidics for rapid CRISPR-based diagnostics and its application to detection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.109637","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has revealed major gaps in our ability to respond to new virulent pathogens. Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In a basic form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex is activated when it highly specifically binds to target DNA, and the activated complex non-specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We recently discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by co-focusing Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab sample. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (from raw sample to result) in 30 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables a new modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.\n\nSignificance statementRapid, early-stage screening is especially crucial during pandemics for early identification of infected patients and control of disease spread. CRISPR biology offers new methods for rapid and accurate pathogen detection. Despite their versatility and specificity, existing CRISPR-diagnostic methods suffer from the requirements of up-front nucleic acid extraction, large reagent volumes, and several manual steps--factors which prolong the process and impede use in low resource settings. We here combine on-chip electric-field control in combination with CRIPSR biology to directly address these limitations of current CRISPR-diagnostic methods. We apply our method to the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples. Our method takes 30 min from raw sample to result, a significant improvement over existing diagnostic methods for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Ramachandran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Diego A Huyke","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eesha Sharma","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Malaya K.

The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation of CbAE-1 in its lipase motif fully abrogated the virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAE-2 presented low toxicity in vivo and in vitro, highlighting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xi Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Liming Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Liangqin Tong","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Nana Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Han Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingyu Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Xiao","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yibin Zhu","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Penghua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, the University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gong Cheng","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.110932","rel_title":"Pooling nasopharyngeal swab specimens to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.110932","rel_abs":"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions.

While sensitive and specific, these RT-PCR assays require considerable supplies and reagents, which are often limited during global pandemics and surge testing. Here, we show that a nasopharyngeal swab pooling strategy can detect a single positive sample in pools of up to 10 samples without sacrificing RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity. We also report that this pooling strategy can be applied to rapid, moderate complexity assays, such as the BioFire COVID-19 test. Implementing a pooling strategy can significantly increase laboratory testing capacity while simultaneously reducing turnaround times for rapid identification and isolation of positive COVID-19 cases in high risk populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cole Anderson","author_inst":"Landstuhl Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fritz Castillo","author_inst":"Landstuhl Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Koenig","author_inst":"Landstuhl Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jim Managbanag","author_inst":"Landstuhl Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Han Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingyu Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Xiao","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yibin Zhu","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Penghua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, the University of Connecticut Health Center"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gong Cheng","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.108563","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 mutations and where to find them: An in silico perspective of structural changes and antigenicity of the Spike protein","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.108563","rel_abs":"The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a severe global health threat characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome (Covid-19).

We analysed 2363 sequences of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 isolates and identified variability in 44 amino acid residues and their worldwide distribution in all continents. We used the three-dimensional structure of the homo-trimer model to predict conformational epitopes of B-cell, and sequence of Spike protein Wuhan-Hu-1 to predict linear epitopes of T-Cytotoxic and T-Helper cells. We identified 45 epitopes with amino acid variations. Finally, we showed the distribution of mutations within the epitopes.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18,354 mutations in S protein were analyzed and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3,705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11,324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The findings comprehensively provide potential target sites in the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaolei Teng","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Adebiyi Sobitan","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Raina Rhoades","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Dongxiao Liu","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Qiyi Tang","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Ubiratan da Silva Batista","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Camila Cavadas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Arturo Reyes-Sandoval","author_inst":"The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, 12 Oxford OX1 2JD, UK"},{"author_name":"Luiz Felipe Leomil Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Alfenas, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Breno de Mello Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gong Cheng","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.109280","rel_title":"A previously uncharacterized gene in SARS-CoV-2 illuminates the functional dynamics and evolutionary origins of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.109280","rel_abs":"Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes.

Methods Three psychiatric centers in Paris and its suburbs took part in the study. We compared the number of total psychiatric emergency consultations during the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France to the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019. We also compared the number of consultations during these 4-week time periods in 2020 and 2019 across different diagnostic categories. Findings In the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France, 553 emergency psychiatry consultations were carried out, compared to 1224 consultations during the corresponding period of 2019, representing a 54.8 % decrease. This decrease was evident across all psychiatric disorders, including anxiety (number of consultations in 2020 representing 36.1 % of 2019), mood (41.1 %), and psychotic disorders (57.3 %). The number of suicide attempts also decreased (number of suicide attempts in 2020 representing 42.6 % of 2019). In comparison to 2019, the proportion of total consultations for anxiety disorders also decreased (16.6 % vs. 20.8 %), whilst the proportion of total consultations increased for psychotic disorders (31.1 % vs. 24.1 %). Conclusions The total number of psychiatric emergency consultations during lockdown dramatically decreased. The psychological consequences of lockdown may be delayed, indicating that psychiatric services should be prepared for a secondary increase in emergency presentations.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baptiste Pignon","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Gourevitch","author_inst":"Sainte Anne Hospital, Paris"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tebeka","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline Dubertret","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Helene Cardot","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Valerie Dauriac-Le Masson","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne-Kristelle Trebalag","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"David Barruel","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Liova Yon","author_inst":"Sainte Anne Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Hemery","author_inst":"Henri Mondor hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Marie Loric","author_inst":"Henri Mondor hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Corentin Rabu","author_inst":"Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Pelissolo","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Marion Leboyer","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Franck Schurhoff","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Pham-Scottez","author_inst":"Sainte Anne hospital, Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101618","rel_title":"Performance of six SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in comparison with microneutralisation","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101618","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays for the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Preferably, the performance of serological tests for a novel virus should be determined with clinical specimens against a gold standard, i.e. virus neutralisation. We evaluated specificity and sensitivity of six commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, including four automated assays [Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG (CE marked), Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG (research use only), and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (CE marked)], and two rapid lateral flow (immunocromatographic) tests [Acro Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG\/IgM (CE marked) and Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgM (CE marked)] in comparison with a microneutralisation test (MNT). Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies with median of 11 days (range 3-51) after onset of symptoms. The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1%\/80.5% (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9%\/43.8% (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 68.3%\/87.8% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6%\/70.7% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4%\/56.1% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5%\/46.3% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5%\/71.9% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8%\/81.3% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgM).

Methods: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity).The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. Results: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV- 2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02). Conclusion: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Yoann Madec","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Grant","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Tondeur","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101709","rel_title":"Risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through comparative studies of laboratory results with influenza","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101709","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 overlaps with the flu season. Methods We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients based on these data. The clinical outcomes were compared among different clusters. Results Temporal analyses of laboratory results revealed that compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in the white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Using these results, we sub-classified the COVID-19 patients into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. We then reviewed the medical record of these patients and risk stratified them based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27.8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Conclusions There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Mei","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Samuel E Weinberg","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lihui Zhao","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Chao Qi","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Adam Frink","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Amir Behdad","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20099325","rel_title":"The \"Double Eights Mask Brace\" Improves the Fit and Protection and Protection of a Basic Surgical Mask Amidst Covid-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20099325","rel_abs":"Study Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread shortages in personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators. While basic surgical facemasks are more commonly available, their efficacy is limited due primarily to their poor face seal. This pilot study examined the impact of a rubber band mask brace on a basic surgical mask, as determined by quantitative fit testing. Methods: Subjects wearing a basic surgical facemask and the rubber band mask brace underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed to certify N95 mask fit. Subjects were tested with the brace anchored behind their eyes, with a paperclip behind the head, and on the side knobs of their face shields. The primary outcome measure was whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test at or above the OSHA verified standard for N95 masks. Results: Subjects (n=11) were 54.5% female, with a median height of 70 inches (IQR 68-74), weight of 170 lbs (IQR 145-215) and BMI of 24.6 (IQR 22.2-27.2), and encompassing 5 distinct N95 mask fit types. We found that 45%, 100% and 100% of subjects passed the quantitative fit test when the brace was anchored behind the ears, with a paperclip and on a face shield respectively. Conclusion: Of the 11 subjects included in the analysis, across a range of body habitus and N95 mask fit types, all passed the quantitative fit test when the mask brace was anchored on either face shield or with a paperclip. This data suggests the brace would offer an improved margin of safety when worn with a basic surgical mask.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel P Runde","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karisa Harland","author_inst":"University of Iowa College of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Paul Van Heukelom","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brett Faine","author_inst":"Iowa College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science,"},{"author_name":"Patrick OShaughnessy","author_inst":"University of Iowa College of Public Health, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mohr","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20066902","rel_title":"Doxycycline and Hydroxychloroquine as Treatment for High-Risk COVID-19 Patients: Experience from Case Series of 54 Patients in Long-Term Care Facilities","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20066902","rel_abs":"Importance: Patients in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are at a high-risk of contracting COVID-19 due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities. Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6% (n=3) patients died in the facilities. Naive Indirect Comparison suggests these data were significantly better outcomes than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57% patients were hospitalized, and 22% patients died. Conclusion: The clinical experience of this case series indicates DOXY-HCQ treatment in high-risk COVID-19 patients is associated with a reduction in clinical recovery, decreased transfer to hospital and decreased mortality were observed after treatment with DOXY-HCQ.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imtiaz Ahmad","author_inst":"Allergy, Sleep & Lung Care, 21st Century Oncology, Fort Myers, FL"},{"author_name":"Mohammud Alam","author_inst":"Cordial Medical PC, Farmingdale, NY"},{"author_name":"Ryan Saadi","author_inst":"Center for Market Access and Medical Innovation, Warren, NJ"},{"author_name":"Saborny Mahmud","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD"},{"author_name":"Emily Saadi","author_inst":"Yale University, School of Public Health, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mohr","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20086488","rel_title":"Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20086488","rel_abs":"Background Since its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic, with more than 4.8 million reported cases and 310 000 deaths worldwide. While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Conclusion Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank Stefan Heldt","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Marcela P Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Sophie Peacock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Mattia Cinelli","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lachlan McLachlan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Fernando Andreotti","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Stojan Jovanovic","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert Durichen","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert A Fletcher","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard A Pointon","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexander Brown","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"James Eaton","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Roberto Liddi","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Tarassenko","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Rabia Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20099317","rel_title":"Early antibody response to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20099317","rel_abs":"Background.

The analytical performance of the method used in the study (Maglumi 800, SNIBE, China) and the effect of two different serum and plasma matrices were also assessed. Results. IgG positivity was demonstrated in 100% of cases 15 days after the onset of the disease. IgM show lower concentrations and do not exceed 77% of cases after 15 days. The analytical performance of the method used was confirmed to be good in terms of imprecision, linearity, commutability in two blood sample matrices. Conclusion. The serological study through the search for specific IgG for SARS-CoV-2 results in our case series is sensitive and suitable for population research and can also play a role in diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of specific IgMs are lower.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruggero Dittadi","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Ospedale dell'Angelo, ULSS3 Serenissima, Mestre, Venice, Italy"},{"author_name":"Haleh Afshar","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Mestre, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Carraro","author_inst":"Laboratory Medicine, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Mestre, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mattia Cinelli","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lachlan McLachlan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Fernando Andreotti","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Stojan Jovanovic","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert Durichen","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert A Fletcher","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard A Pointon","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexander Brown","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"James Eaton","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Roberto Liddi","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Tarassenko","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Rabia Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20086157","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Great Britain: epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the first few hundred (FF100) cases: a descriptive case series and case control analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20086157","rel_abs":"Objectives: Following detection of the first virologically-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Great Britain, an enhanced surveillance study was initiated by Public Health England to describe the clinical presentation, course of disease and identify risk factors for infection of the first few hundred cases. Methods: Information was collected on the first COVID-19 cases according to the First Few X WHO protocol. Case-control analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms and risk factors for infection were conducted. Point prevalences of underlying health conditions among the UK general population were presented. Findings: The majority of FF100 cases were imported (51.4%), of which the majority had recent travel to Italy (71.4%). 24.7% were secondary cases acquired mainly through household contact (40.4%). Children had lower odds of COVID-19 infection compared with the general population. The clinical presentation of cases was dominated by cough, fever and fatigue. Non-linear relationships with age were observed for fever, and sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age. Conditions associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (after adjusting for age and sex) were chronic heart disease, immunosuppression and multimorbidity. Conclusion: This study presents the first epidemiological and clinical summary of COVID-19 cases in Great Britain. The FFX study design enabled systematic data collection. The study was able to characterize the risk factors for infection with population prevalence estimates setting these relative risks into a public health context. It also provides important evidence for generating case definitions to support public health risk assessment, clinical triage and diagnostic algorithms.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola L Boddington","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Elgohari","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Mcdonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chloe Byers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Garcia Vilaplana","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20102509","rel_title":"Low blood sodium increases risk and severity of COVID-19: a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20102509","rel_abs":"Background Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infects human lung tissue cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and the body sodium is an important factor for regulating the expression of ACE2. Through a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study, we found that the low blood sodium population may significantly increase the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We extracted the data of serum sodium concentrations of patients with COVID-19 on admission from the articles published between Jan 1 and April 28, 2020, and analyzed the relationship between the serum sodium concentrations and the illness severity of patients. Then we used a cohort of 244 patients with COVID-19 for a retrospective analysis. Results We identified 36 studies, one of which comprised 2736 patients.The mean serum sodium concentration in patients with COVID-19 was 138.6 mmol\/L, which was much lower than the median level in population (142.0). The mean serum sodium concentration in severe\/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol\/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe\/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations. Conclusions The low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Luo","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiapei Dai","author_inst":"South-Central University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Mcdonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chloe Byers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Garcia Vilaplana","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20101915","rel_title":"Factors Contributing to Healthcare Professional Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Turnaround Global Survey","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20101915","rel_abs":"Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P<0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P<0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). Interpretation: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

But sometimes it is important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is waiting for Bangladesh. Objective: Objective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh. Study design: This study was designed with systematic review and data analysis. Method: The study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate\/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series. Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made. Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 17024322 and total death can be 86265 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher. Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life. A very weak lock down for a long time does not make any sense.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadik Hasan Shuvo","author_inst":"Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University"},{"author_name":"Antonella Castellano","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Scotti","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Mara Scandroglio","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Filippi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabio Ciceri","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Moreno Tresoldi","author_inst":"Unit of General Medicine and Advanced Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Falini","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michael Abern","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Martin Eklund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Hari Vigneswaran","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Stevan M Weine","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104604","rel_title":"Characterization of Patients Who Return to Hospital Following Discharge from Hospitalization For COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104604","rel_abs":"Background: Data on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who return to hospital after discharge are scarce. Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. Methods and Findings: Retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five hospitals in New York City with index hospitalization between February 27th-April 12th, 2020, with follow-up of [&ge;]14 days. Significance was defined as P<0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. Of 2,864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared to patients who did not return, among those who returned there was a higher proportion of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%). Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs. 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; Padjusted=0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; Padjusted=0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, Padjusted=0.064). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned had higher proportion of COPD and hypertension with shorter LOS on index hospitalization, and a trend towards lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sulaiman Somani","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Felix Richter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Valentin Fuster","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jessica De Freitas","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Naik","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mount Sinai Covid Informatics Center (MSCIC)","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Erwin P.

We selected 33 large U.S. cities with a population of >500,000. The integrated numbers of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country to which the city belongs on 14 May 2020, the estimated population in 2019 in the country, and monthly meteorological conditions at the city for 4 months (from January to April 2020) were obtained. Meteorological conditions consisted of mean temperature (F), total precipitation (inch), mean wind speed (MPH), mean sky cover, and mean relative humidity (%). Monthly data for 4 months were averaged or integrated. The Covid-19 prevalence was defined as the integrated number of Covid-19 cases divided by the population. Random-effects meta-regression was performed by means of OpenMetaAnalyst. In a meta-regression graph, Covid-19 prevalence (plotted as the logarithm transformed prevalence on the y-axis) was depicted as a function of a given factor (plotted as a meteorological datum on the x-axis). A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative (coefficient, -0.069; P < 0.001) for the mean temperature and significantly positive for the mean wind speed (coefficient, 0.174; P = 0.027) and the sky cover (coefficient, 2.220; P = 0.023). In conclusion, lower temperature and higher wind speed\/sky cover may be associated with higher Covid-19 prevalence, which should be confirmed by further epidemiological researches adjusting for various risk and protective factors (in addition to meteorological conditions) of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Shizuoka, Japan; Kitasato University, School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Yujiro v","author_inst":"Easton Hospital, Easton, PA, USA"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Shizuoka, Japan; Kitasato University, School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Shizuoka, Japan; Kitasato University, School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Erwin P.

It can be difficult to accurately predict mortality among COVID-19 patients presenting with a spectrum of complications, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease. Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score). Findings: Using a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0.91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature. Interpretation: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arjun S.

Heat inactivation prior to nucleic acid isolation may allow safe testing, while the effects of heat inactivation on SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR detection result need to be determined. Methods: 14 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were inactivated at 56{degrees}C for 30min, 56{degrees}C for 60min, 60{degrees}C for 30min, 60{degrees}C for 75min, and 100{degrees}C for 10min, and another 2 positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were also inactivated at 100{degrees}C for 10min, 100{degrees}C for 30min, 100{degrees}C for 60min, after which the samples were isolated and detected by rRT-PCR. Results: All 14 heat treated samples remained positive. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting ORF1a\/b was 27.228-34.011 in heat-treated samples, while 25.281-34.861 in unheated samples, and the range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed at the time of detecting N was 25.777-33.351 in heat-treated samples, while 24.1615-35.433 in unheated samples, on basis of which it showed no statistical difference otherwise a good correlation of Ct values between the heat-inactivated samples and the untreated samples.

The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite for all strategies aiming to contain the virus. Currently, purification of RNA from patient samples followed by RT-PCR is the gold standard to assess the presence of this single-strand RNA virus. However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2, which alleviates the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples and the ability to detect as little as three viral genome equivalents is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes W.P.

The COVID pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare in hospitals, including the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Hospital-acquired infective endocarditis (HAIE) is a severe complication of medical procedures that has shown a progressive increase in recent years. Objectives. to determine whether the incidence of HAIE during the first two months of the epidemic (March-April 2020) was higher than previously observed and to describe the clinical characteristics of these cases. The probability of studied event (HAIE) during the studied period was calculate by Poisson distribution. Results. Four cases of HAIE were diagnosed in our institution during the study period. The incidence of HAIE during the study period was 2\/patient-month and 0.25\/patient-month during the previous 5 years (p=0.024). Two cases appeared during admission for COVID-19 with pulmonary involvement treated with metilprednisolone and tocilizumab. The other two cases were admitted to the hospital during the epidemic. All cases underwent central venous and urinary catheterization during admission. The etiology of HAIE was Enterococcus faecalis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (one case each). A source of infection was identified in three cases (central venous catheter, peripheral venous catheter, sternal wound infection, respectively). One patient was operated on. There were no fatalities during the first 30 days of follow-up. Conclusion. The incidence of HAIE during COVID-19 pandemic in our institution was higher than usual. In order to reduce the risk of this serious infection, optimal catheter care, appropriate use of corticosteroids and interleukin antagonists and early treatment of every local infection should be prioritized during coronavirus outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ana Fernndez-Cruz","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Fernando Dominguez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Alberto Forteza","author_inst":"HUY Puerta de Hierro-Majadahinda"},{"author_name":"Marta Cobo","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierrro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Isabel Sanchez-Romero","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Angel asensio","author_inst":"HU Puerta deHierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Andreas Marx","author_inst":"University of Konstanz"},{"author_name":"Christof R Hauck","author_inst":"University of Konstanz"},{"author_name":"Zahi Fayad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allan C.
