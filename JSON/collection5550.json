Prioritization of medical countermeasures for evaluation in randomized clinical trials is critically hindered by the lack of COVID-19 animal models that enable accurate, quantifiable, and reproducible measurement of COVID-19 pulmonary disease free from observer bias. We first used serial computed tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical locations (peripheral>central, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes. PET\/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6-12 days post-exposure. Finally, we applied operator-independent, semi-automatic quantification of the volume and radiodensity of CT abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint for immediate and objective efficacy testing of candidate medical countermeasures.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney L.

One of its units is ADP-ribose phosphatase domain (ADRP, also known as macrodomain) which is believed to interfere with the host immune response. Such a function appears to be linked to the proteins ability to remove ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and RNA, yet the precise role and molecular targets of the enzyme remains unknown. Here, we have determined five, high resolution (1.07 - 2.01 [A]) crystal structures corresponding to the apo form of the protein and complexes with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), AMP and ADPr. We show that the protein undergoes conformational changes to adapt to the ligand in a manner previously observed before for in close homologs from other viruses. We also identify a conserved water molecule that may participate in hydrolysis. This work builds foundations for future structure-based research of the ADRP, including search for potential antiviral therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Youngchang Kim","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natalia I.

Binding of S to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be critical for cellular entry. The host range of the virus extends far beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and experimental infections have confirmed high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and hamsters, whereas dogs, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens seem refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the reason for the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to efficiently analyze our dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. Based on our analyses we predict that: (i) the red squirrel is likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and (ii) specific mutations in ACE2 of dogs, rats, and mice render them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Szymon Pach","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmacy, Molecular Drug Design, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Trung Ngoc Nguyen","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmacy, Molecular Drug Design, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jakob Trimpert","author_inst":"Institut fuer Virologie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dusan Kunec","author_inst":"Institut fuer Virologie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Institut fuer Virologie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Wolber","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmacy, Molecular Drug Design, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Solomon","author_inst":"Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Clinical Monitoring Research Program Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research supported by t"},{"author_name":"Philip J.

There's still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus, preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Our cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131), undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions to this pattern. Conclusions: We observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to identify and correct outliers\/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state\/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.

Recent advancements in computer vision motivate more concerted efforts in developing AI-driven diagnostic tools to accommodate the enormous demands for the COVID-19 diagnostic tests globally. To help alleviate burdens on medical systems, we develop a lesion-attention deep neural network (LA-DNN) to predict COVID-19 positive or negative with a richly annotated chest CT image dataset. Based on the textual radiological report accompanied with each CT image, we extract two types of important information for the annotations: One is the indicator of a positive or negative case of COVID-19, and the other is the description of five lesions on the CT images associated with the positive cases. The proposed data-efficient LA-DNN model focuses on the primary task of binary classification for COVID-19 diagnosis, while an auxiliary multi-label learning task is implemented simultaneously to draw the model's attention to the five lesions associated with COVID-19. The joint task learning process makes it a highly sample-efficient deep neural network that can learn COVID-19 radiology features more effectively with limited but high-quality, rich-information samples. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity (recall), precision, and accuracy for COVID-19 diagnosis are 94.0%, 88.8%, 87.9%, and 88.6% respectively, which reach the clinical standards for practical use.

The susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases, and the risks or benefits of immunosuppressive therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Incidences of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. Results. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Systemic autoimmune or immune mediated diseases (AI\/IMID) patients showed a significant increase, whereas inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. IA patients on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts\/bDMARD), but not those on conventional-synthetic (csDMARD), had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. Conclusion. Patients with AI\/IMID show a variable risk of hospital diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of aging, therapies, and disease specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyze the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 L.

We use four phenomenological mathematical models, namely Discrete Exponential Growth model, the Discrete Generalized Growth model, the Discrete Generalized Logistic Growth, and Discrete Generalize Richards Growth model. Our analysis explains the important characteristics quantitatively. The study leads to understand COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan in three evolutionary stages, and provides understanding to control its spread in the short time domain and in the long term domain.

Screening for testing has been based on symptoms typically observed in inpatients, yet outpatient symptom complexes may differ. Methods: Classification and regression trees (CART) recursive partitioning created a decision tree classifying enrollees into laboratory-confirmed cases and non-cases. Demographic and symptom data from patients ages 18-87 years who were enrolled from March 29-April 26, 2020 were included. Presence or absence of SARSCoV2 was the target variable. Results: Of 736 tested, 55 were positive for SARS-CoV2. Cases significantly more often reported chills, loss of taste\/smell, diarrhea, fever, nausea\/vomiting and contact with a COVID-19 case, but less frequently reported shortness of breath and sore throat. A 7-terminal node tree with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 53%, and an AUC of 78% was developed. The positive predictive value for this tree was 14% while the negative predictive value was 99%. Almost half (44%) of the participants could be ruled out as likely non-cases without testing. Discussion: Among those referred for testing, negative responses to three questions could classify about half of tested persons with low risk for SARS-CoV2 and would save limited testing resources. These questions are: was the patient in contact with a COVID-19 case? Has the patient experienced 1) a loss of taste or smell; or 2) nausea or vomiting? The outpatient symptoms of COVID-19 appear to be broader than the well-known inpatient syndrome.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard K Zimmerman","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mary Patricia Nowalk","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Todd Bear","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Rachel Taber","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Theresa M Sax","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Heather Eng","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Goundappa K Balasubramani","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Benjam\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Galindo","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel A.

WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher transmission\/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200 cases of COVID-19 till 18th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries. The malaria free countries not only have higher density of COVID-19 infections but also the higher case fatality rates as compared to highly malaria endemic countries. We also postulate that this phenomenon is due to natural immune response against malaria infection, which is providing a heterologous protection against the virus. Unfortunately, there is no licensed vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 yet, but this information will be helpful in design of future strategies against fast spreading COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Azhar Muneer","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India"},{"author_name":"Kiran Kumari","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"Manish Tripathi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"Rupesh Srivastava","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"Asif Mohmmed","author_inst":"International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India"},{"author_name":"Sumit Rathore","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"Goundappa K Balasubramani","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Benjam\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Galindo","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel A.

A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II) molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for vaccine development.\n\nSignificance StatementThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and B cell epitopes. Utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes, we identified 41 T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen N.

Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this region. Phylogenetic analysis, natural selection investigation and genome recombination analysis were performed. Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to MERS-CoV. Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs. This was further assessed by S gene recombination analysis. These recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus. Moreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates. However, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45). This further indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic. This study thuds sheds further light on the origin of this virus.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported. Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this virus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Islam Nour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim  O.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS- and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the natural host of SARSr-CoVs.\n\nImportanceEvolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS- and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Guo","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xinglou Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Leiping Zeng","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bei Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Songying Ouyang","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Zhengli Shi","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Benjam\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Galindo","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Instituto de Investigacion Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel A.

The pandemic has instigated widespread research related to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease that it causes, COVID-19. Research into this new virus will be facilitated by the availability of clearly described and effective procedures that enable the propagation and quantification of infectious virus. Because work with the virus is recommended to be performed at biosafety level 3, validated methods to effectively inactivate the virus to enable safe study of RNA, DNA and protein from infected cells are also needed. Here, we report methods used to grow SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell lines and to measure virus infectivity by plaque assay using either agarose or microcrystalline cellulose as an overlay as well as a SARS-CoV-2 specific focus forming assay. We also demonstrate effective inactivation by TRIzol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, beta propiolactone, and heat.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander S.

Because this RNA virus can mutate massively without a specifically tracing maker. Herein, using a geographic stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2599 full-genome sequences, we identified that two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C>T and 25563.G>T) of linkage disequilibrium were presented in approximately half of North America SARS-CoV-2 population (p = 2.44 x 10-212 and p = 2.98 x 10-261), resulting two missense mutations (i.e., Thr 265 Ile and Gln 57 His) in ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively. Interestingly, these two SNPs exclusively occurred in the North America dominated clade 1, accumulated during mid to late March, 2020. We did not find any of these two SNPs by retrospectively tracing the two SNPs in bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV-2 from the first epicenter Wuhan or other regions of China mainland. This suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 population of Chinese mainland were different from the prevalent strains of North America. Time-dependently, we found that these two SNPs first occurred in Europe SARS-CoV-2 (26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the occurring date of North America isolates and 17 days early for Asia isolates (Taiwan China dominated). Collectively, this population genetic analysis highlights a well-confidential transmission route of the North America isolates and the two SNPs we newly identified are possibly novel diagnosable or druggable targets for surveillance and treatment.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xumin Ou","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Zhishuang Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Dekang Zhu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Sai Mao","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mingshu Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Renyong Jia","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Shun Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mafeng Liu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Shaqiu Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Juan Huang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Qun Gao","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yunya Liu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Maikel Peopplenbosch","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qiuwei Pan","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"An-chun Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Tracey Burdette","author_inst":"Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD "},{"author_name":"Martha C.

There is an urgent need for serological tests to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which could be used to assess the prevalence of infection, as well as ascertain individuals who may be protected from future infection. Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which may lack scalability to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the coming year. Herein, we present an alternative method of antibody testing that just depends on one protein reagent being added to patient serum\/plasma or whole blood and a short five-minute assay time. A novel fusion protein was designed that binds red blood cells (RBC) via a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the H antigen and displays the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of RBCs. Upon mixing of the fusion protein, RBD-scFv with recovered COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs, we observed agglutination of RBCs, indicating the patient developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Given that the test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed with only the protein reagent required at projected manufacturing cost at U.S. cents per test. We anticipate our agglutination assay may find extensive use in low-resource settings for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Competing Interest StatementR.L.K. is an inventor on a provisional patent application related to the work described in the manuscript.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social-distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, and contact-tracing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to build the community herd immunity needed to effectively control and eliminate the pandemic. This study is based on the design and use of a mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19. An analytical expression for the minimum number of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with mortality data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Florida, as well as for the entire US, show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, the minimum herd immunity threshold for the entire US, state of New York and state of Florida are, respectively, 90%, 84% and 85%. Furthermore, it was shown that, while a significantly large increase in vaccination rate (from baseline) is necessarily needed to eliminate COVID-19 from the entire US, the pandemic can be eliminated from the states of New York and Florida if the vaccination rate is marginally increased (by as low as 10%) from its baseline value. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US or in the two states of New York and Florida is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with a public mask use program or an effective social-distancing measure. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold. Finally, it is shown that the vaccination program is more likely to lead to COVID-19 elimination in the state of Florida, followed by the state of New York and then the entire US.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enahoro Amos Iboi","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Calistus N.

We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that the local strategy results in a similar number coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases but significantly fewer person-days of closure, even under high inter-county travel scenarios. However, both cases and person-days lost to closure rise when county triggers are not coordinated and when testing rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that pandemic planning for the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider local strategies for re-opening and re-closing.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vadim Karatayev","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Chris T Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Eric A Gehrie","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Tim K Amukele","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Aaron AR Tobian","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Heba H Mostafa","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Zack Z Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ying Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Shaqiu Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Juan Huang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Qun Gao","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yunya Liu","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Maikel Peopplenbosch","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qiuwei Pan","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"An-chun Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Tracey Burdette","author_inst":"Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD "},{"author_name":"Martha C.

Methods: We recruited 32 patients who had 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19; 18 hospitalized and actively symptomatic, 14 recovered mild cases), and measured levels of IgM (against the full-length S1 or the highly homologous SARS-CoV E protein) and IgG (against S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]). We performed the same analysis in 103 pre-2020 healthy adult control (HC) participants and 13 participants who had negative molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were very elevated within days of symptom onset for hospitalized patients (median 2.04 optical density [OD], vs. 0.12 in HC). People who recovered from milder COVID-19 only reached similar IgG levels 28 days after symptom onset. IgM levels were elevated early in both groups (median 1.91 and 2.12 vs. 1.14 OD in HC for anti-S1 IgM, 2.23 and 2.26 vs 1.52 in HC for anti-E IgM), with downward trends in hospitalized cases having longer disease duration. The combination of the two IgM levels showed similar sensitivity for COVID-19 as IgG but greater specificity, and identified 4\/10 people (vs. 3\/10 by IgG) with prior symptoms and negative molecular testing to have had COVID-19. Conclusions: Disease severity and timing both influence levels of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, with IgG better for early detection of severe cases but IgM more suited for early detection of milder cases.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tugba Ozturk","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christina Howell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Karima Benameur","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Richard P Ramonell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Cashman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shama Pirmohammed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leda Bassit","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vince C Marconi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Raymond F Schinazi","author_inst":"Emory U"},{"author_name":"Whitney Wharton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

We employ a combination of XGBoost and MultiOutputRegressor as machine learning model (ML model). For each province, we conduct a binary classification whether our ML model can classify provinces where total infection cases over the coming 24 days is more than 100. The result is Sensitivity = 3\/3 = 100%, Specificity = 11\/14 = 78.6%, False Positive Rate = 3\/11 = 21.4%, Accuracy = 14\/17 = 82.4%. Sensitivity = 100% means that we did not overlook the three provinces where the number of COVID-19 infection cases increased by more than100. In addition, as for the provinces where the actual number of new COVID-19 infection cases is less than 100, the ratio (Specificity) that our ML model can correctly estimate was 78.6%, which is relatively high. From the above all, it is demonstrated that there is a sufficient possibility that our ML model can support the following four points. (1) Promotion of behavior modification of residents in dangerous areas, (2) Assistance for decision to resume economic activities in each province, (3) Assistance in determining infectious disease control measures in each province, (4) Search for factors that are highly correlated with the future increase in the number of COVID-19 infection cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoshiro Suzuki","author_inst":"Tokyo Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ayaka Suzuki","author_inst":"Ernst&Young Shinnihon LLC"},{"author_name":"Karima Benameur","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Richard P Ramonell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Cashman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shama Pirmohammed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leda Bassit","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vince C Marconi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Raymond F Schinazi","author_inst":"Emory U"},{"author_name":"Whitney Wharton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision. A comparative study has also been done with the recently published works and it is observed the performance of the proposed model is significantly better.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saurabh Kumar","author_inst":"MAHATMA GANDHI CENTRAL UNIVERSITY, BIHAR, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Shweta Mishra","author_inst":"MAHATMA GANDHI CENTRAL UNIVERSITY, BIHAR, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Singh","author_inst":"MAHATMA GANDHI CENTRAL UNIVERSITY, BIHAR, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Richard P Ramonell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Cashman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shama Pirmohammed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Leda Bassit","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vince C Marconi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Raymond F Schinazi","author_inst":"Emory U"},{"author_name":"Whitney Wharton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"F.

But there were some challenges during mNGS implementation in clinical settings such as time consuming manipulation and lack of comprehensive analytical validation. Methods: We set up CATCH that was a mNGS method based on RNA and DNA hybrid tagmentation via Tn5 transposon. Seven respiratory RNA viruses and three subtypes of Influenza A virus had been used to test capabilities of CATCH on detection and quantification. Analytical performance of SARS CoV 2 and Influenza A virus had been determined with reference standards. We compared accuracy of CATCH with quantitative real time PCR by using clinical 98 samples from 64 COVID19 patients. Results: We minimized the library preparation process to 3 hours and handling time to 35 minutes. Duplicate filtered RPM of 7 respiratory viruses and 3 Influenza A virus subtypes were highly correlated with viral concentration. LOD of SARS CoV 2 was 39.2 copies\/test and of Influenza A virus was 278.1 copies\/mL. Comparing with quantitative real time PCR, the overall accuracy of CATCH was 91.4%. Sensitivity was 84.5% and specificity was 100%. Meanwhile, there were significant difference of microbial profile in oropharyngeal swabs among critical, moderate patients and healthy controls. Conclusion: Although further optimization is needed before CATCH can be rolled out as a routine diagnostic test, we highlight the potential impact of it advancing molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feili Wei","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Yanhua Yu","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongjie Hu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine of Liver Disease, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Xianghua Guo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Haiying Jin","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Shan Guo","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Yabo Ouyang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Ying Shi","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"Dexi Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China;  Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engi"},{"author_name":"F.

Methods: From December 26, 2019 to March 15, 2020, 1514 severe and 249 critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients were collected from two medical centers in Wuhan, China. We performed multivariable Cox models, Cox model with time-varying exposure and propensity score analysis (both inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM)) to estimate the association of corticosteroid use with the risk of in-hospital mortality among severe and critical cases. Results: Corticosteroids were administered in 531 (35.1%) severe and 159 (63.9%) critical patients. Compared to no corticosteroid use group, systemic corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality in both severe cases (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, p=0.023), and critical cases (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.08-3.98, p=0.028). In the time-varying Cox analysis that with time varying exposure, systemic corticosteroid use still showed no benefit in either population (for severe patients, HR=2.83, 95% CI: 1.72-4.64, p< 0.001; for critical patients, HR=3.02, 95% CI: 1.59-5.73, p=0.001). Baseline characteristics were matched after IPTW and PSM analysis. For severe COVID-19 patients at admission, corticosteroid use was not associated with improved outcome in either the IPTW analysis. For critical COVID-19 patients at admission, results were consistent with former analysis that corticosteroid use did not reduce in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Corticosteroid use showed no benefit in reducing in-hospital mortality for severe or critical cases. The routine use of systemic corticosteroids among severe and critical COVID-19 patients was not recommended.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianfeng Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianqiang Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Guochao Zhu","author_inst":"The Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University (No. Six Hospital of Wuhan)"},{"author_name":"Yihao Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Han Xiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Si","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yi","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Cuiping Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Daya Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shuling Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xin Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zelong Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qiongya Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingquan Lv","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ying Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Yu","author_inst":"The Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University (No. Six Hospital of Wuhan)"},{"author_name":"Xiangdong Guan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yanbing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"KarKeung Cheng","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sui Peng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Xiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Marisa C.

Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. Results 200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18.5%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9.5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score [&ge;]2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg\/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). Conclusions This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg\/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Regina","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthaios Papadimitriou-Olivgeris","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raphael Burger","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paraskevas Filippidis","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Tschopp","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Florian Desgranges","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Viala","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eleftheria Kampouri","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laurence Rochat","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Haefliger","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mhedi Belkoniene","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fidalgo","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonios Kritikos","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katia Jaton","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laurence Senn","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Alexandre Bart","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Pagani","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Oriol Manuel","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Loic Lhopitallier","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"KarKeung Cheng","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sui Peng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Xiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Marisa C.

It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Methods: Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Results: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%. Conclusion: Given the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Joyner","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"R.

Most countries in Asia and Africa have national BCG vaccination program while Europe and America do not have such program, or have ceased it. At present, there is no known therapy to treat COVID-19 disease. There is no vaccine available currently to prevent COVID- 19 disease.

We have computed two basic reproduction number, one at vaccine free equilibrium point and other at non-vaccine free equilibrium point and carried out local stability, sensitivity and numerical analysis. Our result showed that individuals with BCG vaccinations have lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection, shorter hospital stays, and increased rate of recovery.

As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing global interest in the role of serological testing for population monitoring and to inform public policy. However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We aimed to synthesize the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provide recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts. Methods. This was a rapid systematic review of cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting seroprevalence outcomes for SARS-CoV 2. We included completed, ongoing, and proposed serosurveys. The search included electronic databases (PubMed, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, and WHO ICTPR); five medical journals (NEJM, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine); reports by governments, NGOs, and health systems; and media reports (Google News) from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics and critically appraised prevalence estimates using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Results. Seventy records met inclusion criteria, describing 73 studies. Of these, 23 reported prevalence estimates: eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report. These studies had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%. No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk, 21% moderate risk, 36% unclear). Fifty records reported characteristics of ongoing or proposed serosurveys. Overall, twenty countries have completed, ongoing, or proposed serosurveys. Discussion. Study design, quality, and prevalence estimates of early SARS-CoV2 serosurveys are heterogeneous, suggesting that the urgency to examine seroprevalence may have compromised methodological rigour.
