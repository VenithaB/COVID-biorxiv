Design: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. Setting: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service (NHS) authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making. Participants: Publicly-available data on COVID-19 patients. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction (\"R\") number over time. Results: SW model projections indicate that, as of the 11th May 2020 (when 'lockdown' measures were eased), 5,793 (95% credible interval, CrI, 2,003 - 12,051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW England population, 95%CrI 0.04 - 0.22%), and a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 - 277,955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 - 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on the 11th May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95%CrI 169 - 1,543) and 110 (95%CrI 8 - 464) respectively. The R value in SW England was predicted to be 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 - 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95%CrI 1.8 - 2.9) and lockdown\/ school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95CrI% 0.5 - 0.7). Conclusions: The developed model has proved a valuable asset for local and regional healthcare services. The model will be used further in the SW as the pandemic evolves, and - as open source software - is portable to healthcare systems in other geographies.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ross D Booton","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Louis MacGregor","author_inst":"Population Health Science Institute, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Vass","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katharine J Looker","author_inst":"Population Health Science Institute, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hyams","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip D Bright","author_inst":"Immunology, Pathology Sciences, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Irasha Harding","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajeka Lazarus","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"Infection Science, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lawson","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pratt","author_inst":"Principal BI Analyst Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Richard Wood","author_inst":"Head of Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine M E Turner","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20121541","rel_title":"A Fully Automated Deep Learning-based Network ForDetecting COVID-19 from a New And Large Lung CT ScanDataset","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20121541","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a severe global problem, and AI can play a significant role in preventing losses by monitoring and detecting infected persons in early-stage. This paper aims to propose a high-speed and accurate fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's CT scan images. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infections. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false detections. At the next stage, we introduce a novel method for increasing the classification accuracy of convolutional networks. We implemented our method using the ResNet50V2 network and a modified feature pyramid network alongside our designed architecture for classifying the selected CT images into COVID-19 or normal with higher accuracy than other models. After running these two phases, the system determines the condition of the patient using a selected threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system in two different ways. In the single image classification stage, our model achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 test images. At the patient identification phase, the system correctly identified almost 234 of 245 patients with high speed. We also investigate the classified images with the Grad-CAM algorithm to indicate the area of infections in images and evaluate our model classification correctness.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rahimzadeh","author_inst":"Iran University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Abolfazl Attar","author_inst":"Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mohammad Sakhaei","author_inst":"Sari Azad University"},{"author_name":"Katharine J Looker","author_inst":"Population Health Science Institute, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hyams","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip D Bright","author_inst":"Immunology, Pathology Sciences, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Irasha Harding","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajeka Lazarus","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"Infection Science, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lawson","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pratt","author_inst":"Principal BI Analyst Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Richard Wood","author_inst":"Head of Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine M E Turner","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20119206","rel_title":"A Comparative Study of Target Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Resolution CT for Patients with Corona-Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20119206","rel_abs":"Background: The corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious public health risk. Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, matrix 512), ultra-high resolution CT (U-HRCT, matrix 1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit volume by about 4 times. Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: U-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed thatperipleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern were independent indictors of the COVID-19 on U-HRCT. U-HRCT was superior to C-HRCT in showing the blood vessels, bronchial wall, and interlobular septum in the ground-glass opacities; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions:Peripleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19. U-HRCT is superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular septum for evaluating COVID-19.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ plus standard of care in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and web of sciences were searched up to June 1, 2020. The references list of the key studies was reviewed for additional relevant resources. Clinical studies registry databases were searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaborations tool. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3). Results: Three randomized controlled trials with total number of 242 patients were identified eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between HCQ and standard care in terms of viral clearance (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.16; P= 0.68), disease progression (RR=0.92; 95% CI= 0.10, 0.81; P=0.94), Chest CT (RR=1.40; 95% CI= 1.03, 1.91; P=0.03).

To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability efficient method is urgently needed. Objectives: To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 Methods: Direct clinical sample and NA pooling approach was used for the standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 targeting the envelop (E) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. In this approach, experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples spiked with up to 9 negative samples prior to NA extraction step to have a final extraction volume of 200L (maximum dilution factor of 10). Viral NA was also subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Results: We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the ct value of the original sample, corresponding to high, medium, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies\/reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend poling of 4 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 4 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the ct value (relative RNA copy number) of the sample spiked and result in a 237% increase in testing efficiency. Conclusions: The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andargachew Mulu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dawit Hailu Alemayehu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Fekadu Alemu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dessalegn Abeje Tefera","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sinknesh Wolde","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gebeyehu Aseffa","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tamrayehu Seyoum","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Meseret Habtamu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alemseged Abdissa","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Abebe Genetu Bayih","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tesfaye Beyene","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pratt","author_inst":"Principal BI Analyst Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Richard Wood","author_inst":"Head of Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine M E Turner","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123299","rel_title":"Early administration of lopinavir\/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study.","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123299","rel_abs":"Background The potential benefit of a combination therapy with lopinavir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on COVID-19 has been speculated. We explored the effect of the timing of LPV\/r + HCQ initiation on the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 who started treatment with LPV\/r plus HCQ between February 21 and March 20, 2020, at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy. Over time cumulative incidence of clinical improvement was compared between patients who started treatment less than 5 days from the onset of symptoms [early treatment group (ET)] and those who initiated it later [delayed treatment group (DT)]. The association of LPV\/r plus HCQ initiation timing on 30-day mortality was also assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic models. Results The study included 172 patients, prevalently males (72%) in their sixties, with a moderate (53.4%) or severe (34.9%) disease. Fourty-three (25%) patients were included in the ET group and and 129 (75%) in the DT group. Severity of disease did not significantly differ between the two groups. Conclusion Timing of LPV\/r + HCQ initiation seems to have no impact on COVID-19 clinical course in terms of improvement and 30-day mortality. These findings rise doubts on the clincial efficacy of this regimen.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Lisa Ridolfo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Oreni","author_inst":"Luigi Sacco Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences DIBIC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Pezzati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bradanini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Casalini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Passerini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Torre","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Gubertini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ceriani","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Gervasoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cattaneo","author_inst":"Luigi Sacco Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences DIBIC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20122036","rel_title":"Differences in antibody kinetics and functionality between severe and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20122036","rel_abs":"We determined and compared the humoral immune response in severe, hospitalized and mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Emergency department (ED) screening in symptomatic patients with normal vital signs is frequently limited to oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We tested the null hypothesis that patients being screened for CoVid-19 in the ED with normal vital signs and without hypoxia would have a point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) consistent with CoVid-19 less than 2% of the time. Methods Subjects Subjects were identified from ED ultrasound logs. Inclusion criteria Age 14 years or older with symptoms prompting ED screening for CoVid-19. Exclusion criteria Known congestive heart failure or other chronic lung condition likely to cause excessive B lines on LUS. Intervention Structured blinded ultrasound review and chart review Analysis We used an exact hypothesis tests for binomial random variables. We also measured LUS diagnostic performance using computed tomography as the gold standard. Results We reviewed 77 charts; 62 met inclusion criteria. Vital signs were normal in 31 patients; 10 (32%) of these patients had LUS consistent with CoVid-19. We rejected the null hypothesis (p-value for bitest <0.001).

Both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the US exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing NYC and LA testing data, we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the US data is mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA datasets. Periodic oscillations in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies.

There is a pressing need to adopt effective measures prevention and containment of in such settings. Design: Retrospective cohort study assessing the effect of enhanced surveillance and early preventative strategies and comparing outcomes for people with severe epilepsy and other comorbidities Setting: Three long-term care facilities: Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy (CCE), St. Elisabeth (STE), and The Meath (TM) with different models of primary and specialist care involvement, in the United Kingdom Participants: 286 long-term residents (age range 19-91 years), 740 carers who had been in contact with the residents during the observation period between 16 March and 05 June 2020. Interventions: Early preventative and infection control measures with identification and isolation of symptomatic cases, with additional enhanced surveillance and isolation of asymptomatic residents and carers at one site (CCE) Main outcome measures: Infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 among residents and carers, asymptomatic rate and case fatality rate, if available. Results: During a 12-week observation period, we identified 29 people (13 residents) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive with confirmed outbreaks amongst residents in two long-term care facilities (CCE, STE). At CCE, two out of 98 residents were symptomatic and tested positive, one of whom died. A further seven individuals testing positive on weekly enhanced surveillance had a completely asymptomatic course. One asymptomatic carer tested positive after contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients in another institution. Since 30 April 2020, during on-site weekly enhanced surveillance all 275 caregivers tested repeatedly negative. At STE, three out of 146 residents were symptomatic and tested positive, a fourth tested positive during hospital admission for symptoms not related to COVID-19. Since April 6, 2020, 105\/215 carers presenting with typical symptoms for COVID-19 were tested, of whom 15 tested positive. At TM, testing of symptomatic carers only started from early\/mid-April, whilst on-site testing, even of symptomatic residents, was not available until recently. During the observation period, eight of 80 residents were symptomatic but none was tested. Twenty-six of 250 carers were symptomatic and were tested, of whom two tested positive. Conclusions: Infection outbreaks in long-term care facilities for vulnerable people with epilepsy can be quickly contained, but only if asymptomatic cases are identified through enhanced surveillance at individual and care staff level. We observed a low rate of morbidity and mortality which confirmed that preventative measures with isolation of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 can reduce resident-to-resident and reverse resident-to-carer transmission.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Balestrini","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Matthias J Koepp","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sonia Gandhi","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rickman","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Gee Yen Shin","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Houlihan","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Jonny Anders-Cannon","author_inst":"Epilepsy Society"},{"author_name":"Katri Silvennoinen","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Fenglai Xiao","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20122275","rel_title":"Predictors of household food insecurity in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20122275","rel_abs":"Objective: To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model. Setting: The United States during the week of March 30, 2020. Participants: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. Results: 1,517 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 30% reported food insecurity after the COVID-19 outbreak, 53% were women and 72% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident household food insecurity. Black respondents, Hispanic\/Latino respondents, and respondents with annual income less than $100,000 were significantly more likely to experience incident household food insecurity. Individuals experiencing incident household food insecurity were 2.09 (95% CI 1.58-2.83) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.88 (95% CI 1.37-2.52) times more likely to screen positively for depression. Conclusions: Food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable.

Methods A comparative analysis of analytical sensitivity was performed of seven commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, composed of 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and 64 healthcare workers with paucisymptomatic infections. The kinetics of IgA\/IgM\/IgG seroconversion to viral N- and S-protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after symptom onset. Specificity was verified on 57 pre-pandemic samples. Results Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test achieved a superior overall sensitivity. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG\/IgA also showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) versus the consensus result of all assays from 10 days post symptom onset. Optimal specificity (>98%) was achieved only by Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG showed a significantly lower sensitivity as compared to all other assays.

Existing stochastic SIR models incorporate SSEs by fitting distributions with thin tails, or finite variance, and therefore predicting almost deterministic epidemiological outcomes in large populations. This paper documents evidence from recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, that SSEs follow a power law distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. We then extend an otherwise standard SIR model with estimated power law distributions, and show that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will lead to large aggregate uncertainties in infection dynamics, even with large populations. That is, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks will be unpredictable. While such uncertainties have social costs, we also find that they on average decrease the herd immunity thresholds and the cumulative infections because per-period infection rates have decreasing marginal effects. Our findings have implications for social distancing interventions: targeting SSEs reduce not only the average rate of infection (R0) but also its uncertainty. To understand this effect, and to improve inference of the average reproduction numbers under fat tails, estimating the tail distribution of SSEs is vital.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masao Fukui","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Chishio Furukawa","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dieter De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Koen Swaerts","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"An-Sofie Decavele","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chin Hur","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonny Anders-Cannon","author_inst":"Epilepsy Society"},{"author_name":"Katri Silvennoinen","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Fenglai Xiao","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123448","rel_title":"The effectiveness of social bubbles as part of a Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy, a modelling study","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123448","rel_abs":"Background: During the Covid-19 lockdown, contact clustering in social bubbles may allow extending contacts beyond the household at minimal additional risk and hence has been considered as part of modified lockdown policy or a gradual lockdown exit strategy. We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. Methods: We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, that is stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate a number of strategies including variations of social bubbles, i.e. the forming of exclusive pairs of households, for particular subsets of households (households including children and single occupancy households), as well as for all households. We test the sensitivity of the results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. Results: Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive social bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting some of the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case scenario social bubbles reduced cases and fatalities by 17% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to 1.1 and therefore beyond the epidemic threshold of one. However, strategies that allow households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles only increased the reproduction number by less than 10%. The corresponding increase in morbidity andmortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is largely focussed in older adults independently of whether these are included in the social bubbles.

Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states. Objective This article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African Americans in the southern states. Methodology This short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Second, the unacast COVID-19 toolkit was used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline). Results Across the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed racial disparities in our healthcare system that disproportionately impacts African Americans within the four states of the southern United States. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system likely impacts this disproportionate impact on African American communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within minority communities. Recognizing that there is a great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities.

Methods: We calculate the probability of a confirmed infection, hospitalization, and death resulting from a county-level person-contact using available data on current case incidence, secondary attack rates, infectious periods, asymptomatic infections, and ratios of confirmed infections to hospitalizations and fatalities. Results: Among US counties with populations greater than 500,000 people, during the week ending June 13,2020, the median estimate of the county level probability of a confirmed infection is 1 infection in 40,500 person contacts (Range: 10,100 to 586,000). For a 50 to 64 year-old individual, the median estimate of the county level probability of a hospitalization is 1 in 709,000 person contacts (Range: 177,000 to 10,200,000) and the median estimate of the county level probability of a fatality is 1 in 6,670,000 person contacts (Range 1,680,000 to 97,600.000). Conclusions and Relevance: Estimates of the individual probabilities of COVID19 infection, hospitalization and death vary widely but may not align with public risk perceptions. Systematically collected and publicly reported data on infection incidence by, for example, the setting of exposure, type of residence and occupation would allow more precise estimates of probabilities than possible with currently available public data. Calculation of secondary attack rates by setting and better measures of the prevalence of seropositivity would further improve those estimates.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajiv Bhatia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Klausner","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Helena Stage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20124453","rel_title":"Jinhua Qinggan granule, a Chinese herbal medicine against COVID-19, induces rapid changes in the plasma levels of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20124453","rel_abs":"Background: Currently, effective vaccines or specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19 are not available.

However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of JHQGG has not been confirmed. Objectives: We thus examined whether the administration of JHQGG affects hematological and immunological measures in healthy individuals. Method: We enrolled 18 healthy volunteers, all of whom tested negative for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood samples were collected 1 h after oral administration of JHQGG and subjected to hematological, biochemical, and cytokine tests. Results: JHQGG rapidly induced a significant decrease in the plasma level of IL-6 and an increase in the plasma level of IFN-{gamma}.

This study aims at analyzing clinical presentation on admission and the determinants associated with direct admission or transfer to intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: In this prospective hospital-based study, socio-demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, on admission, of adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. The outcome was admission\/transfer to intensive care units compared with total hospital stay in medical wards according to patient characteristics. Results: Of the 412 patients included, 325 were discharged and 87 died in hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of admission\/transfer to ICUs with male gender (OR, 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07-3.73]), temperature (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.88] per degree Celsius increase), abnormal lung auscultation on admission (OR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.40-4.90]), elevated level of CRP (OR, 6.96 [95% CI, 1.45-33.35 for CRP>100mg\/L vs CRP<10mg\/L). Increased time was observed between symptom onset and hospital admission (OR, 4.82 [95% CI, 1.61-14.43] for time >10 days vs time <3 days) and monocytopenia (OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.29-4.82]). Monocytosis was associated with lower risk of admission\/transfer to ICUs (OR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.05-1.13]). Conclusions: Clinical and biological features on admission and time until admission were associated with admission to ICUs. Signs to predict worsening on admission could be partially associated with the time until admission. This finding reinforces the need for appropriate guidelines to manage COVID-19 patients in this time window.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Marie-Paule Gustin","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Christelle ELIAS","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laetitia HENAFF","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Cedric DANANCHE","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Beatrice GRISI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elodie MUNIER-MARION","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nagham KHANAFER","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20125013","rel_title":"Successful contact tracing systems for COVID-19 rely on effective quarantine and isolation","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20125013","rel_abs":"Background. Test, trace and isolate are the three crucial components of the response to COVID-19 identified by the World Health Organisation. Mathematical models of contact tracing often over-simplify the ability of traced contacts to quarantine or isolate. Method. We use an age-structured branching process model of individual disease transmission combined with a detailed model of symptom onset, testing, contact quarantine and case isolation to model each aspect of the test, trace, isolate strategy. We estimated the effective reproduction number under a range of scenarios to understand the importance of each aspect of the system. Findings. People's ability to quarantine and isolate effectively is a crucial component of a successful contact tracing system. 80% of cases need to be quarantined or isolated within 4 days of quarantine or isolation of index case to be confident the contact tracing system is effective. Interpretation. Provision of universal support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively, coupled with investment in trained public health professionals to undertake contact tracing, are crucial to success. We predict that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system with strong support structures in place, combined with moderate social distancing measures, is required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

This equation accounts for asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic or latent transmission as well as contact tracing and isolation, and leads to a transparent definition of the instantaneous reproduction number R. For different parameter values, the model equation admits different classes of solutions. These solution classes correspond to, inter alia, containment of the outbreak via public health measures, exponential growth despite public health measures, containment despite reopening and second wave following reopening. We believe that the spread of COVID in every localized area such as a city, district or county can be accounted for by one of our solution classes. In regions where R > 1 initially despite aggressive epidemic management efforts, we find that if the mitigation measures are sustained, then it is still possible for R to dip below unity when far less than the region's entire population is affected, and from that point onwards the outbreak can be driven to extinction in time. We call this phenomenon partial herd immunity. Our analysis indicates that COVID-19 is an extremely vicious and unpredictable disease which poses unique challenges for public health authorities, on account of which case races among various countries and states do not serve any purpose and present delusive appearances while ignoring significant determinants.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit M Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua, Landcare Research, New Zealand."},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Shaun Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Annette Nesdale","author_inst":"Hutt Valley District Health Board, NZ"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, NZ"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20091322","rel_title":"A study on the appropriate use of topdown approachfor stepping up economic activities in districts ofdifferent States\/Union Territories in India","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20091322","rel_abs":"At the beginning of phase 4.0 of lockdown , every State \/Union Territories(UT) needs to take appropriate mitigation efforts (lockdown and testing ) that may change red zones to orange and even to green zones by May 31, 2020.

Pool testing even reduces the number of false positives in the absence of dilution effects.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Pikovski","author_inst":"self-employed"},{"author_name":"Kajetan Bentele","author_inst":"no institution"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua, Landcare Research, New Zealand."},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Shaun Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Annette Nesdale","author_inst":"Hutt Valley District Health Board, NZ"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, NZ"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125534","rel_title":"Interregional SARS-CoV-2 spread from a single introduction outbreak in a meat-packing plant in northeast Iowa","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125534","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 spread has proven to be especially difficult to mitigate in high risk settings, including nursing homes, cruises, prisons and various industrial settings. Among industrial settings, meat processing facilities in the United States have experienced particularly challenging outbreaks. We have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 whole viral genomes from individuals testing positive in an integrated regional healthcare system serving 21 counties in southwestern Wisconsin, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, providing an overview of SARS-CoV-2 introduction and spread in a region spanning multiple jurisdictions with differing mitigation policies. While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility, affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning 185 square miles. This study highlights the regional public health consequences of failures to rapidly act to mitigate viral spread in a single industrial setting.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Craig S Richmond","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Arick P Sabin","author_inst":"Gundersen Health System"},{"author_name":"Dean A Jobe","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Steven D Lovrich","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Paraic A Kenny","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Shaun Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Annette Nesdale","author_inst":"Hutt Valley District Health Board, NZ"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, NZ"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125542","rel_title":"Covid-19 vs BCG: a Statistical Significance Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125542","rel_abs":"We present an updated time-adjusted dataset and conclusions at Covid19 Time Zero + 5 month (04.06.2020).

Circumstances in the Italian provinces of Milano, Bergamo, Brescia, and Lodi allow estimation of lower bounds for age- and sex-specific all-cause excess mortality (a proxy for IFR) since anecdotal reports indicate some towns were close to fully infected. Using data from ISTAT on mortality from January 1 through April 15 for 2020 and the three preceding years, I estimate excess mortality by sex and age categories (0-14, 15-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years) while controlling for town-specific mortality that proxies for town-specific infection rate. The 99th percentile from the tail of the town distribution gives a lower-bound estimate for COVID-19 mortality. The overall population-weighted mortality at the 99th percentile is 1.09 percent (95% CI 1.06-1.14). The age- and sex-specific rates vary considerably: for men age 65-74 the estimate is 2.10 percent (95% CI 1.94-2.28) which is 3.5-times higher than men 55-64 and 2.7-times higher than women 65-74.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas S Coleman","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Arick P Sabin","author_inst":"Gundersen Health System"},{"author_name":"Dean A Jobe","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Steven D Lovrich","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Paraic A Kenny","author_inst":"Gundersen Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Shaun Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland, NZ"},{"author_name":"Annette Nesdale","author_inst":"Hutt Valley District Health Board, NZ"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, NZ"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126474","rel_title":"Clinical validation and performance evaluation of the automated Vitros Total Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies assay for screening of serostatus in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126474","rel_abs":"Objectives: Evaluation of serostatus against SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an important tool in identification of exposure to COVID-19. We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: We performed validation studies according to COLA guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections. We also evaluated concordance with molecular and other serological testing, and evaluated seroconversion. Results: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision, was resistant to analytical interference, and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with samples positive for other respiratory viruses. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56\/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56\/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples, and was concordant with other serological assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% > 7 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, however, the use of the CoV2T and other serological assays in clinical management of COVID-19 patients is yet unknown, and must be evaluated in future studies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily Garnett","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joanna Jung","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Estella Tam","author_inst":"Texas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Rajapakshe","author_inst":"Texas Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen Cheney","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cameron Brown","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth L Muldrew","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jing Cao","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ila Singh","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James Versalovic","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sridevi Devaraj","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126946","rel_title":"Use of face coverings by the public during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126946","rel_abs":"Public health agencies have recommended that the public wear face coverings, including face masks, to mitigate COVID-19 transmission.

Areas suggested for improved contributions by the private sector related to patient care (71.8%) and provision of equipment (62.4%), with fewer expectations (39.9%) on the research front. Another area of deemed support was maintaining continuity of care for non-COVID patients using virtual consultation services (77.4%), tele-consultation being the preferred option (60%). 58.2% felt that the Government had not involved the private sector adequately; and 45.1% felt they should be part of policy-making.
