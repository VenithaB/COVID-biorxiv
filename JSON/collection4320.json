Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science databases and grey literature for studies reporting epidemiological and clinical data of patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Eligible studies were all observational or interventional studies and commentaries in English language that reported patient data on HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. We used random effect meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence and mortality. Results: Of the 17 eligible studies, there were 3 retrospective cohorts, 1 survey, 5 case series, 7 case reports and 1 commentary that reported on a total of 146 HIV infected individuals. The pooled prevalence of HIV among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.0 - 3.0, I2 = 79.3%, p=0.01), whereas the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HIV patients was 0.68% (95% CI: 0.34 - 1.34). There were 110 (83.8%) HIV\/ SARS-CoV-2 co-infected males, and the age (range) of the co-infected was 30 - 60 years. A total of 129 (97.0%) were anti-retroviral therapy experienced, and 113 (85.6%) had a suppressed HIV viral load. The CD4 count (range) was 298 - 670 cells\/mm3 (n = 107). The commonest symptoms were fever (73.5%, n=75) and cough (57.8%, n = 59). Sixty-two (65.3%) patients had at least one other comorbid condition, of which hypertension (26.4%, n = 38) was the commonest. Chest radiological imaging abnormalities were found in 46 (54.1%) cases. Twenty-eight cases (56.0%) were reported as mild. Recovery occurred in 120 (88.9%) cases, and the pooled mortality was 9% (95% CI: 3.0 - 15.0, I2 = 25.6%, p =0.24). Conclusion: The prevalence of HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection was low. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of HIV\/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection are comparable to those reported among HIV negative SARS-CoV-2 cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Baruch Baluku","author_inst":"Mulago National Referral Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ronald Olum","author_inst":"Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Curthbert Agolor","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"},{"author_name":"Josephine Nakakande","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"},{"author_name":"Laura Russell","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Felix Bongomin","author_inst":"Gulu University"},{"author_name":"Jane Nakaweesi","author_inst":"Mildmay Uganda"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hiv aids"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119651","rel_title":"Ethnically diverse mutations in PIEZO1 associate with SARS-CoV-2 positivity","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119651","rel_abs":"Fatality from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a major problem globally and so identification of its underlying molecular mechanisms would be helpful. The combination of COVID-19 clinical data and genome sequence information is providing a potential route to such mechanisms. Here we took a candidate gene approach to UK Biobank data based on the suggested roles of endothelium and membrane proteins in COVID-19. We focussed on the PIEZO1 gene, which encodes a non-selective cation channel that mediates endothelial responses to blood flow. The analysis suggests 3 missense PIEZO1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All of them affect amino acids in the proximal N-terminus of PIEZO1, which is an unexplored region of the protein. By using molecular modelling we predict location of all 3 amino acids to a common outward-facing structure of unknown functional significance at the tips of the PIEZO1 propeller blades. Through genome sequence analysis we show that these SNPs vary in prevalence with ethnicity and that the most significant SNP (rs7184427) varies between 65 to 90% even though the reference amino acid is evolutionarily conserved. The data suggest PIEZO1 as a contributor to COVID-19 fatality and factor in ethnic susceptibility.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chew W Cheng","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Vijayalakshmi Deivasikamani","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Melanie J Ludlow","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Dario De Vecchis","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Antreas C Kalli","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"David J Beech","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Piruthivi Sukumar","author_inst":"University of Leeds"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118760","rel_title":"Model Based Covid-19 Case Studies in the UK, the USA and India","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118760","rel_abs":"Time dependent spread of Covid-19 among the population of the UK, the USA and India is analyzed using a recently developed mathematical model [1-3].

COVID-19 infection has led to an overwhelming effort by health institutions to meet the high demand for hospital admissions. Aim. To analyse the clinical variables associated with readmission of patients who had previously been discharged after admission for COVID-19. Design and methods. We studied a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted and subsequently discharged alive. We then conducted a nested case-control study paired (1:1 ratio) by age, sex and period of admission. Results. Out of 1368 patients who were discharged during the study period, 61 patients (4.4%) were readmitted. Immunocompromised patients were at increased risk for readmission. There was also a trend towards a higher probability of readmission in hypertensive patients (p=0.07). Cases had had a shorter hospital stay and a higher prevalence of fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge. There were no significant differences in oxygen levels measured at admission and discharge by pulse oximetry intra-subject or between the groups. Neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio at hospital admission tended to be higher in cases than in controls (p=0.06). The motive for readmission in 10 patients (16.4%), was a thrombotic event in venous or arterial territory (p<0.001). Neither glucocorticoids nor anticoagulants prescribed at hospital discharge were associated with a lower readmission rate. Conclusions. The rate of readmission after discharge from hospital for COVID-19 was low. Immunocompromised patients and those presenting with fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge are at greater risk of readmission to hospital.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lina Marcela Parra","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"MIreia Cantero","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Morras","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Alberto Vallejo","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Itziar Diego","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Jimenez-Tejero","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Elena Munez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Angel Asensio","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Ana Fernandez-Cruz","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"},{"author_name":"Antonio Ramos-Martinez","author_inst":"HU Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117358","rel_title":"Tocilizumab for treatment of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117358","rel_abs":"Background Severe COVID-19 can manifest in rapid decompensation and respiratory failure with elevated inflammatory markers. This presentation is consistent with cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, for which IL-6 blockade is approved treatment. Methods We assessed effectiveness and safety of IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab in a single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was survival probability post-intubation; secondary analyses included an ordinal illness severity scale integrating superinfections. Outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab compared to tocilizumab-untreated controls were evaluated using multivariable Cox regression with propensity score inverse probability weighting (IPTW). Findings 154 patients were included, of whom 78 received tocilizumab and 76 did not. Median follow-up was 47 days (range 28-67). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, although tocilizumab-treated patients were younger (mean 55 vs. 60 years), less likely to have chronic pulmonary disease (10% vs. 28%), and had lower D-dimer values at time of intubation (median 2.4 vs. 6.5 mg\/dL). In IPTW-adjusted models, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in hazard of death [hazard ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.33, 0.90)] and improved status on the ordinal outcome scale [odds ratio per 1-level increase: 0.59 (0.36, 0.95)]. Though tocilizumab was associated with an increased proportion of patients with superinfections (54% vs. 26%; p<0.001), there was no difference in 28-day case fatality rate among tocilizumab-treated patients with versus without superinfection [22% vs. 15%; p=0.42]. Interpretation In this cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, tocilizumab was associated with a decreased likelihood of death despite higher superinfection occurrence. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily C Somers","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Gregory A Eschenauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Troost","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Golob","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tejal N Gandhi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nina Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lindsay A Petty","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Baang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nicholas O Dillman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David Frame","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin S Gregg","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dan R Kaul","author_inst":"University of MIchigan"},{"author_name":"Jerod Nagel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Twisha S Patel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20116772","rel_title":"Characterizing and Forecasting Emergency Department Visits Related to COVID-19 Using Chief Complaints and Discharge Diagnoses","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20116772","rel_abs":"In response to the unprecedented public health challenge posed by the SARS CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) in the United States, we and our colleagues at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU\/APL) have developed a model of COVID-19 progression using emergency department (ED) visit data from the National Capital Region (NCR). We obtained ED visits counts through targeted queries of the NCR Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE). To focus on ED visits by COVID-19 patients, we adjusted the query results for typical ED visit volumes and for reductions in ED volumes due to COVID-19 precautions. With these ED visit data, we fitted a logistic growth model to characterize and forecast the increase in cumulative COVID-19 ED visits. Our model achieves the best fit when we assume that the first NCR visit occurred in early January. We estimate that approximately 15,000 COVID-19 ED visits occurred prior to May 2020 and that approximately 17,000 more visits will occur in subsequent months. We plan to deploy an operational pilot of this model in the NCR ESSENCE environment, assisting local public health authorities as they brace for a second wave of COVID-19. Additionally, we will iteratively assess potential model refinements, aiming to maximize the relevance of our model for the situational awareness and decision-making of local public health authorities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phillip Koshute","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rekha Holtry","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Richard Wojcik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wayne Loschen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sheri Lewis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nina Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lindsay A Petty","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Baang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Nicholas O Dillman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David Frame","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kevin S Gregg","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Dan R Kaul","author_inst":"University of MIchigan"},{"author_name":"Jerod Nagel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Twisha S Patel","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117945","rel_title":"COVID-SGIS: A smart tool for dynamic monitoring and temporal forecasting of Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117945","rel_abs":"Objective The new kind of coronavirus SARS-Cov2 spread to countries in all continents in the World. The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) causes fever, cough, sore throat, and in severe cases shortness of breath and death. To evaluate strategies, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Study Design Monitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days. Methods Our developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented. Results ARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. In Brazil, the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied between 2.56% and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts outside the prediction interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, and Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. Conclusion The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a robust, flexible and fast way. Since it is based on information from multiple databases, it can be adapted to the different realities, becoming an important tool to guide the course of politics and action against Covid-19 pandemic worldwide.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarisse Lins de Lima","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Cordeiro da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ana Clara Gomes da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Luiz Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117770","rel_title":"COVID-19 apparent reproductive number dropped during Spain's nationwide dropdown, then spiked at lower-incidence regions","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117770","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide.

We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions regions - but increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt, associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures, in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread; and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities).

In the first month of COVID-19 infection, incidence of daily positive cases did follow the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) based predictions we reported in April, but started to deviate in the following months. COVID-19 transmission and disease progression depends on multifaceted determinants e.g. viral genetics, host immunity, social distancing, co-morbidity, socio-demographic and environmental parameters. Therefore deviation in confirmed cases from predicted model may appear and warrant thorough investigation. Methods: In this short report, we compared real data with SIR model and analyzed the possible factors associated with the deviation which included preventive intervention strategies, socioeconomic capabilities, climatic and meteorological indexes, acquired immunity of Bangladeshi population, demographic characteristics, health indicators and food habits. Results: The key factor responsible for the observed deviation was found to be the number of tests performed. Having population with low median age, young age groups are being mostly infected. Low prevalence of non-communicable diseases among them and strong immunity compared to the elderly might have kept most of them asymptomatic with silent recovery. Warm temperature, humidity and UV index of Bangladesh during this summer period might have contributed to the slow progression of infection. Longer daylight mediated immunity, fresh air circulations and ventilation, less population density in rural areas and certain food habits perhaps helped the large number of populations to restrict the infection up to a level. Conclusion: Despite all these helpful determinants in Bangladesh, person to person contact is still the leading risk factor for COVID-19 transmission. Infection may increase rapidly if safe distance and preventive measures are not strictly followed while resuming the normal social and work life. Expanding test capacity, strong collaborative action plans, strategies and implementation are needed immediately to prevent catastrophe.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Khulna University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Bangladesh University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ana Clara Gomes da Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Luiz Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117416","rel_title":"Kalman Filter Based Short Term Prediction Model for COVID-19 Spread","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117416","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has emerged as global medical emergency in recent decades. The spread scenario of this pandemic has shown many variations. Keeping all this in mind, this article is written after various studies and analysis on the latest data on COVID-19 spread, which also includes the demographic and environmental factors. After gathering data from various resources, all data are integrated and passed into different Machine Learning Models to check the fit. Ensemble Learning Technique,Random Forest, gives a good evaluation score on the test data. Through this technique, various important factors are recognised and their contribution to the spread is analysed. Also, linear relationship between various features is plotted through heatmap of Pearson Correlation matrix. Finally, Kalman Filter is used to estimate future spread of COVID19, which shows good result on test data. The inferences from Random Forest feature importance and Pearson Correlation gives many similarities and some dissimilarities, and these techniques successfully identify the different contributing factors. The Kalman Filter gives a satisfying result for short term estimation, but not so good performance for long term forecasting. Overall, the analysis, plots, inferences and forecast are satisfying and can help a lot in fighting the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr Koushlendra Kumar Singh","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Jamshedpur"},{"author_name":"Suraj Kumar","author_inst":"National institute of Technology Jamshedpur"},{"author_name":"Prachi Dixit","author_inst":"Jai Narayan Vyas University, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Dr Manish Kumar Bajpai","author_inst":"PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design Manufacturing Jabalpur"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118448","rel_title":"Meta-analysis of several epidemic characteristics of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118448","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has strongly disrupted people's daily work and life, a great amount of scientific research has been conducted to understand the key characteristics of this new epidemic.

Face mask wearing is one important measure to suppress the pandemic. In order to know how efficient is face mask wearing in reducing the pandemic even with low efficiency non-professional face masks, we exploit physical abstraction to model the non-professional face masks made from cotton woven fabrics and characterize them by a parameter virus penetration rate (VPR){gamma}. Monte Carlo simulations exhibit that the effective reproduction number R of COVID-19 or similar pandemics can be approximately reduced by factor {gamma}4 with respect to the basic reproduction number R0,if the face masks with 70% <{gamma}< 90% are universally applied for the entire network. Furthermore, thought experiments and practical exploitation examples in country-level and city-level are enumerated and discussed to support our discovery in this study and indicate that the outbreak of a COVID-19 like pandemic can be even suppressed by the low efficiency non-professional face masks.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yejian Chen","author_inst":"Bell Laboratories, Nokia"},{"author_name":"Meng Dong","author_inst":"Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Sharon Xiangwen Xie","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dr Manish Kumar Bajpai","author_inst":"PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design Manufacturing Jabalpur"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117523","rel_title":"Missing clinical trial data: the knowledge gap in the safety of potential COVID-19 drugs","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117523","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the knowledge gap in safety data by quantifying the number of missing clinical trial results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. Design: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched using the NCT number to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. Results: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. 1172 (31.2%) completed trials had tabular results on ClinicalTrials.gov. A further 1066 (28.4%) completed trials had results from the literature search, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). Conclusion: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause a large burden of additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Florence Rodgers","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Toby Pepperrell","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarai Keestra","author_inst":"1.\tSchool of Anthropology & Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, UK   2.\tDepartment of Global Health & Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical M"},{"author_name":"Victoria Pilkington","author_inst":"Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Souza Marques","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Lucas Job Brito de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Luiz Antonio Albuquerque Junior","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Samuel Barbosa Jatoba de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica de Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Anwar Musah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Patty Kostkova","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20117168","rel_title":"Using newspapers obituaries to nowcast daily mortality: evidence from the Italian COVID-19 hot-spots","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20117168","rel_abs":"Real-time tracking of infectious disease outbreaks helps policymakers to make timely data-driven decisions.

OBJECTIVE: To develop, externally validate and prospectively test a transparent deep learning algorithm for predicting 24 hours in advance the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational cohort study SETTING: Two academic medical centers from January 01, 2016 to December 31, 2019 (Retrospective cohorts) and February 10, 2020 to May 4, 2020 (Prospective cohorts). PARTICIPANTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the intensive care units (ICUs) at two hospitals. Additionally, 777 patients with COVID-19 patients were used for prospective validation. Patients who were placed on mechanical ventilation within four hours of their admission were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME(S) and MEASURE(S): Electronic health record (EHR) data were extracted on an hourly basis, and a set of 40 features were calculated and passed to an interpretable deep-learning algorithm to predict the future need for mechanical ventilation 24 hours in advance. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (based on heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, FiO2 and pH) was used to assess future need for mechanical ventilation. Performance of the algorithms were evaluated using the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, the external validation cohort included 3,888 general ICU and 402 COVID-19 patients. The performance of the model (AUC) with a 24-hour prediction horizon at the validation site was 0.882 for the general ICU population and 0.918 for patients with COVID-19. In comparison, commonly used clinical criteria and the ROX score achieved AUCs in the range of 0.773 - 0.782 and 0.768 - 0.810 for the general ICU population and patients with COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS and RELEVANCE: A generalizable and transparent deep-learning algorithm improves on traditional clinical criteria to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians with optimizing timing of tracheal intubation, better allocation of mechanical ventilation resources and staff, and improve patient care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Supreeth P.

Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, it is essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling. Methods: A COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number (R_0, a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to R_0. Results: The estimated basic reproduction number is R_0=4.63, which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission (R_1=2.42), the contaminated environment also played a significant role.

Many recently released point-of-care (PoCT) serological assays have been distributed with little pre-market validation. Methods: Performance characteristics for five PoCT lateral flow devices approved for use in Australia were compared to a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a recently described novel surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT). Results: Sensitivities for PoCT ranged from 51.8% (95% CI 43.1 to 60.4%) to 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI 89.2-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI 96.1-100.0%). Overall ELISA sensitivity for either IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6), increasing to 93.8% (95% CI 85.0-98.3%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset. Overall, sVNT sensitivity was 60.9% (95% CI 53.2-68.4%), rising to 91.2%% (95% CI 81.8-96.7%) for samples collected >14 days post-symptom onset, with a specificity 94.4% (95% CI 89.2-97.5%), Conclusion: Performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays were generally lower than those reported by manufacturers. Timing of specimen collection relative to onset of illness or infection is crucial in the reporting of performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays. The optimal algorithm for implementing serological testing for COVID-19 remains to be determined, particularly in low-prevalence settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine Bond","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Suellen Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Seok Lim","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Theo Karapanagiotidis","author_inst":"Melbourne Health"},{"author_name":"Eloise Williams","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Douglas Johnston","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Cheryll Sia","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Damian Purcell","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sharon Lewin","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Mike Catton","author_inst":"Melbourne Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamon P Howden","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at the Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20119032","rel_title":"Clinical Features and Predictors for Patients with Severe SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: a retrospective multicenter cohort study","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20119032","rel_abs":"Objectives: This study was performed to investigate clinical features of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and identify risk factors for converting to severe cases in those who had mild to moderate diseases. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were included. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between non-severe and severe patients. Results: 58 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had a longer: time to clinical recovery (p=0.0011), duration of viral shedding (p=0.0183), and hospital stay ( p=0.0211). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with the rate of converting to severe cases (odds ratio 1.28, 95%CI 1.06-1.54, per 0.1*10 9\/L reduced; p=0.007), while using of low-to-moderate doses of systematic corticosteroids was associated with reduced likelihood of converting to a severe case (odds ratio 0.14, 95%CI 0.02-0.80; p=0.0275). Conclusions: The low peripheral blood lymphocyte count was an independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients converting to severe cases. This finding may help clinicians more accurately predict prognosis, and triage priorities to improve clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao Cao","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiping Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yiting Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lili Yu","author_inst":"Jingzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weina Huang","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuanbing Zhu","author_inst":"Jingzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinguo Chu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li He","author_inst":"Jingzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingping Ma","author_inst":"Jingzhou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Chen","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamon P Howden","author_inst":"University of Melbourne at the Doherty Institute"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Abel Guilhermino da Silva Filho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Zhou","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Adam S Lauring","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"David A Hanauer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Pratima Sharma","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20118067","rel_title":"Rethinking antiviral effects for COVID-19 in clinical studies: early initiation is key to successful treatment","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20118067","rel_abs":"Development of an effective antiviral drug for COVID-19 is a global health priority.

This study focuses specifically on the efficacy of stay-at-home orders, both nationally and internationally, in the control of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis from April to May 2020 and included countries and US states with known stay-at-home orders. Our primary exposure was the time between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 to an implemented stay-at-home mandate for each region. Our primary outcomes were the time from the first reported case to the highest number of daily cases and daily deaths. We conducted simple linear regression analyses, controlling for the case rate of the outbreak. RESULTS: For US states and countries, a larger number of days between the first reported case and stay-at-home mandates was associated with a longer time to reach the peak daily case and death counts. The largest effect was among regions classified as the latest 10% to implement a mandate, which in the US, predicted an extra 35.3 days to the peak number of cases (95 % CI: 18.2, 52.5), and 38.3 days to the peak number of deaths (95 % CI: 23.6, 53.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the potential beneficial effect of earlier stay-at-home mandates, by shortening the time to peak case and death counts for US states and countries. Regions in which mandates were implemented late experienced a prolonged duration to reaching both peak daily case and death counts.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandra Medline, MPH","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lamar Hayes, MPH","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Farnoosh Vahedi","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katia Valdez","author_inst":"Fielding School of Public Health, University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jake Sonnenberg","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Will Capell","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ami Hayashi","author_inst":"David Geffen School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zoe Glick","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

Cytokines that can classify populations in different states of SARS-CoV-2 infection were first screened in cross-sectional serum samples from 184 subjects by 2 statistical analyses. The resultant cytokines were then analyzed for their interrelationships and fluctuating features in sequential samples from 38 COVID-19 patients. Three cytokines, M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF, which were clustered into 3 different correlation groups and had relatively small fluctuations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, were selected for the construction of a multiclass classification model. This model discriminated healthy individuals and asymptomatic and nonsevere patients with accuracy of 77.4% but was not successful in classifying severe patients. Further searching led to a single cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which classified severe from nonsevere COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 97.9% under a cutoff value of 1128 pg\/ml. The level of this cytokine did not increase in nonsevere patients but was significantly elevated in severe patients. Considering its potent antiinflammatory function, we suggest that HGF might be a new candidate therapy for critical COVID-19. In addition, our new strategy provides not only a rational and effective way to focus on certain cytokine biomarkers for infectious diseases but also a new opportunity to probe the modulation of cytokines in the immune response.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hai-Jun Deng","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Quan-Xin Long","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Bei-Zhong Liu","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ji-Hua Ren","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Pu Liao","author_inst":"Laboratory department, Chongqing People Hospital, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fu Qiu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Jun Tang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yin-Yin Xu","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhan Mo","author_inst":"Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jieli Hu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ai-Long Huang","author_inst":"The Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Infectious Diseases designated by the Chinese Ministry of"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"Christ Church, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 1DP, UK"},{"author_name":"Kenji Shibuya","author_inst":"Institute for Population Health, Kings College London, London"},{"author_name":"Katsuhito Fujiu","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Iwami Shingo","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117721","rel_title":"A comparative evaluation of dye-based and probe-based RT-qPCR assay for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 using individual and pooled-sample testing.","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117721","rel_abs":"Effective interventions are mandatory to control the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious virus causing devastating effects worldwide. Cost-effective approaches are pivotal tools required to increase the detection rates and escalate further in massive surveillance programs, especially in countries with limited resources that most of the efforts have focused on symptomatic cases only. Here, we compared the performance of the RT-qPCR using an intercalating dye with the probe-based assay. Then, we tested and compared these two RT-qPCR chemistries in different pooling systems: after RNA extraction (post-RNA extraction) and before RNA extraction (pre-RNA extraction) optimizing by pool size and template volume. We evaluated these approaches in 610 clinical samples. Our results show that the dye-based technique has a high analytical sensitivity similar to the probe-based detection assay used worldwide. Further, this assay may also be applicable in testing by pool systems post-RNA extraction up to 20 samples. However, the most efficient system for massive surveillance, the pre-RNA extraction pooling approach, was obtained with the probe-based assay in test up to 10 samples adding 13.5 uL of RNA template. The low cost and the potential use in pre-RNA extraction pool systems, place of this assays as a valuable resource for scalable sampling to larger populations. Implementing a pool system for population sampling results in an important savings of laboratory resources and time, which are two key factors during an epidemic outbreak.

Methods We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020. Results Up to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n=43, 63%), patients relatives (n=16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n=5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n=46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n=5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515). Conclusion The investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erwan Sallard","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris, 45 Rue D'Ulm, 75005, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francois-Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau"},{"author_name":"Charles Burdet","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Guedj","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau"},{"author_name":"Nathan Peiffer-Smadja","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, IAME, INSERM, F-75018, Paris, France; Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat- Clau"},{"author_name":"Carmen Lopez-Joven","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Carlos Loncoman","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Claudio Navarrete","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Ramirez-Reveco","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Alex Romero","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silva","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Matias Vega","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Cristobal Verdugo","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Vergara","author_inst":"Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Kenji Shibuya","author_inst":"Institute for Population Health, Kings College London, London"},{"author_name":"Katsuhito Fujiu","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Iwami Shingo","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118018","rel_title":"Continuous positive airway pressure face-mask ventilation to manage massive influx of patients requiring respiratory support during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118018","rel_abs":"Background: Since December 2019, a global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is responsible for massive influx of patients with acute respiratory failure in hospitals. We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a large public hospital in France. Method: It is a single centre retrospective observational cohort. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients who had signs of respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, despite receiving 10 to 15 l\/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, were treated by CPAP with a face-mask unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. The main outcomes under study were reasons for CPAP discontinuation and mortality. Results: A total of 585 patients were admitted in Delafontaine hospital for severe COVID-19. ICU was quickly overwhelmed. Fifty-nine out of 159 (37%) patients requiring ICU care had to be referred to other hospitals. CPAP therapy was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). SARS-CoV2 pneumonia was confirmed by PCR from respiratory tract in 39 (79%) patients and by thoracic CT scan in the remaining patients. CPAP was performed out of ICU in 41 (84%) cases. Median age was 65 years (IQR=54-71). Median duration of CPAP treatment was 3 days (IQR=1-5). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were intubation for invasive ventilation in 25 (51%) patients, improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%). A decision not to intubate had been taken for the 2 patients who died while on CPAP. Conclusions: Treatment with CPAP is feasible and safe in a non-ICU environment in the context of a massive influx of patients. One third of these patients with high oxygen requirements did not eventually need invasive ventilation.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Alviset","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Quentin Riller","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Jerome Aboab","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Kelly Dilworth","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes"},{"author_name":"Pierre Alain Billy","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Yannis Lombardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Azzi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20118125","rel_title":"Reduction in stroke patients' referral to the ED in the COVID-19 era: A four-year comparative study","rel_date":"2020-06-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20118125","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction. Current reports indicate that the increased use of social distancing for preventive COID-19 distribution may have a negative effect on patients who suffering from acute medical conditions. Aim. We examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients' referral to the emergency department (ED) Method. A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS, number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or combine) and in-hospital death. Results. The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of final AIS diagnosis for the year of 2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the highest diagnosis rate demarcated for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed patients. The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the examined years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47). Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in routing constraints on health care system resources that were dedicated for treating COVID-19 patients. The healthcare system must develop and offer complementary solutions that will enable access to health services even during these difficult times.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mor Saban","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Epidemiology & Health Policy Research"},{"author_name":"Anna Reznik","author_inst":"Rambam health care campus"},{"author_name":"Tal Shachar","author_inst":"Bar Ilan university"},{"author_name":"Rotem Sivan-Hoffmann III","author_inst":"Rambam health care campus"},{"author_name":"Pierre Alain Billy","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Yannis Lombardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Azzi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Luis Ferreira Vargas","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Laurent Laine","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Lermuzeaux","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Memain","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Silva","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Tona Tchoubou","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Daria Ushmorova","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Hanane Dabbagh","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Simon Escoda","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Remi Lefrancois","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Annelyse Nardi","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Armand Ngima","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Vincent Ioos","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de Saint Denis Hopital Delafontaine"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Fung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jason M Pogue","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"}]}
