SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric forms, and\/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction and in the random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Craig Fenwick","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antony Croxatto","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alix T.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle V Evans","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Andres V Garchitorena","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement"},{"author_name":"Rado JL Rakotonanahary","author_inst":"Pivot"},{"author_name":"John M Drake","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Andriamihaja","author_inst":"Pivot"},{"author_name":"Elinambinina Rajaonarifara","author_inst":"Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, France"},{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Benjamin ROCHE","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Bonds","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Julio Rakotonirina","author_inst":"University of Antananarivo"},{"author_name":"Berend Jan Bosch","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Semira Gonseth Nussle","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Murielle Bochud","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Valerie D'Acremont Genton","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Greub","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Pantaleo","author_inst":"Lausanne University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20151126","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust, neutralizing antibody responses that are stable for at least three months","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20151126","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with millions infected and numerous fatalities.

Preparedness of institutions during epidemic outbreak has a pivotal role in saving lives and preventing further spread. At the same time, these pandemics impact badly on professional and personal life of Health care workers. The objective of this study is to find the opinion of Health care workers regarding their level of preparedness, concerns and perceived impact related to this pandemic outbreak. Materials and Methods: in this study, random samples of doctors and nurses was provided with a self-administered questionnaire regarding their preparedness, work and non-work related concerns and impact on their lives during Covid-19 outbreak. Results: Most of the Health Care Workers believed that their institute preparation to fight Covid-19 pandemic is better than prior to onset of this crisis (p<0.001). Work related stress was seen more commonly in nurses whereas higher frequency of non-work related stress was observed among doctors. Nurses (75.55%) faith in their employer was more than doctors faith (46.66%) regarding their medical needs. There was more acceptance of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19 in doctors compared to nurses (p <0.01). Conclusions: Though this institute was more prepared at the time of pandemic spread, substantial opportunity of improvement remains. The consistency of work and non work related anxiety and stress in health care workers is very high in present study group. Concerns and risks of Health Care Workers should be addressed ethically and adequately by strengthening safety measures and building trust in the system they work.

Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is particularly often needed among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in SSA is travel time. To inform the geographic targeting of additional healthcare resources, this study aimed to determine the estimated travel time at a 1km x 1km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in SSA. Methods: We assembled a unique dataset on healthcare facilities' geolocation, separately for hospitals and any type of healthcare facility (including primary care facilities) and including both private- and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the KEMRI Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1km x 1km resolution was obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility for each 1km x 1km raster using a cost-distance algorithm. Findings: 9.6% (95% CI: 5.2% - 16.9%) of adults aged 60 and older years had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of longer than six hours, varying from 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.7%) in Burundi and The Gambia, to 40.9% (95% CI: 31.8% - 50.7%) in Sudan. 11.2% (95% CI: 6.4% - 18.9%) of adults aged 60 years and older had an estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility of any type (whether primary or secondary\/tertiary care) of longer than three hours, with a range of 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.8%) in Burundi to 55.5% (95% CI: 52.8% - 64.9%) in Sudan. Most countries in SSA contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of more than 12 hours and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type of more than six hours. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 and older years with the longest travel times was 348 minutes (IQR: 240 - 576 minutes) for the entire SSA population, ranging from 41 minutes (IQR: 34 - 54 minutes) in Burundi to 1,655 minutes (IQR: 1065 - 2440 minutes) in Gabon. Interpretation: Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and healthcare facilities of any type can be used by policymakers and non-governmental organizations to help target additional healthcare resources, such as new make-shift hospitals or transport programs to existing healthcare facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows precisely where population groups are located that are particularly likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to healthcare facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform countries' efforts to improve care for conditions that are common among older adults, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal Geldsetzer","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care and Population Health, Department of Medicine, Stanford University; Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Marcel Reinmuth","author_inst":"Institute of Geography, Heidelberg University; HeiGIT at Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Paul O Ouma","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Sven Lautenbach","author_inst":"HeiGIT at Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme; Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Dep"},{"author_name":"Till Baernighausen","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, Heidelberg University; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed in order to explore the source of heterogeneity and results consistency. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are more likely to have blood group A (pooled OR 1.21; 95%CI: 1.08-1.37) and less likely to have blood group O (pooled OR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.66-0.87). Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms at the basis of this association, which may affect the kinetics of the pandemic according to the blood group distribution within the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide Golinelli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna."},{"author_name":"Erik Boetto","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna."},{"author_name":"Elisa Maietti","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna."},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Fantini","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences (DIBINEM), Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna."},{"author_name":"Ted Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Shiming Chen","author_inst":"China Anti-tuberculosis Association, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Qingshan Cai","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, Zhejiang Provincial Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Kan","author_inst":"Department of Scientific Research and Education, Anhui Chest Hospital, Hefei, Anhui Province, China"},{"author_name":"Peilan Zong","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, Jiangxi Chest Hospital, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zhong Zeng","author_inst":"Division of Tuberculosis, The Fifth People's Hospital, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China"},{"author_name":"Shouyong Tan","author_inst":"Department of Tuberculosis, Guangzhou Chest Hospital.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is known as the mechanism for severe forms of other coronavirus diseases. The clinical progression of COVID-19 before and after IgG antibody seroconversion was investigated. Methods: Fifty-three patients with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCT)-confirmed COVID-19 viral pneumonia with or without respiratory failure were retrospectively investigated. The timing of the first IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2-positive date, as well as changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and blood lymphocyte numbers, was assessed using serial preserved blood samples. Findings: Ten patients recovered without oxygen therapy (mild\/moderate group), 32 patients had hypoxemia and recovered with antiviral drugs (severe\/non-ICU group), and 11 patients had severe respiratory failure and were treated in the ICU (6 of them died; critical\/ICU group). The first IgG-positive date (day 0) was observed from 5 to 18 days from the onset of disease. At day 0, a CRP peak was observed in the severe and critical groups, whereas there was no synchronized CRP peak on day 0 in the mild\/moderate group. In the severe\/non-ICU group, the blood lymphocyte number increased (P=0.0007) and CRP decreased (P=0.0007) after day 0, whereas CRP did not decrease and the blood lymphocyte number further decreased (P=0.0370) in the critical\/ICU group. Interpretation: The respiratory failure due to COVID-19 viral pneumonia observed in week 2 may be related to an antibody-related mechanism rather than uncontrolled viral replication. In the critical form of COVID-19, inflammation was sustained after IgG seroconversion.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kazuyoshi Kurashima","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Naho Kagiyama","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Takashi Ishiguro","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Yotaro Takaku","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Hiromi Nakajima","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Shun Shibata","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Yuma Matsui","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Kenji Takano","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Taisuke Isono","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Takashi Nishida","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Eriko Kawate","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Chiaki Hosoda","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Yoichi Kobayashi","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Noboru Takayanagi","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Yanagisawa","author_inst":"Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center"},{"author_name":"Peng Sun","author_inst":"Tuberculosis Hospital of JiLin Province, Changchun, Jilin Province, China"},{"author_name":"Guihui Wu","author_inst":"Department of Tuberculosis, Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Cui Cai","author_inst":"Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment Quality Control Center, Guiyang Public Health Treatment Center, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, Guizhou Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Wang","author_inst":"The Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Kaixing Ai","author_inst":"Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Liu","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Zheng'an Yuan","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154112","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in an entirely PCR-sampled and quarantined community after a COVID-19 outbreak - the CoNAN study","rel_date":"2020-07-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154112","rel_abs":"Background: Due to the substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses many SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting immunity in a defined population. Methods: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study in the previously quarantined community Neustadt-am-Rennsteig, Germany six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with 49 cases identified by PCR screening of all 883 inhabitants. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine the rate of seroconversion in children; ii.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; iii.) to investigate the rate of virus persistence. Findings: We enrolled 626 participants (71% of the community population). All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative; while a total of 8.4% (52 of 620 tested) had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two independent tests. Twenty of the antibody positive participants had previously a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. On the contrary, of those 38 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 20 (52.6%) were antibody positive. Interpretation: Several antibody tests conducted six weeks after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 did not detect all previously PCR-positive tested individuals. Cautious evaluation of antibody testing strategies to assess immunity against the infection is warranted.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Weis","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andre Scherag","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Baier","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Kiehntopf","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kamradt","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steffi Kolanos","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juliane Ankert","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stefan Gloeckner","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Oliwia Makarewicz","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hagel","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christina Bahrs","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aurelia Kimmig","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hans Proquitte","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joel Guerra","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bettina Loeffler","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mathias W.

Methods: Individuals with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete an online survey between April 23-May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnosis, we compared the frequency of symptoms and poor outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed the effects of the pandemic on access to medical care and other services, and in PwPD, its effects on PD symptoms. Results: Among 5,429 PwPD and 1,452 without PD, 77 reported a COVID-19 diagnosis (51 PwPD, 26 without PD). Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. PwPD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) PD symptoms. PwPD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened PD motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for PwPD living alone, and for those with lower income and non-white race. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of PwPD.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan G Brown","author_inst":"Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California - San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Lana M Chahine","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Samuel M.

Background: Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among frontline nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardised scales. Results: Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support, personal resilience and organisational support predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Conclusions: Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. Implication for Nursing Management: COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leodoro Labrague","author_inst":"Sultan Qaboos University"},{"author_name":"Janet Alexis De los Santos","author_inst":"Visayas State University"},{"author_name":"Samuel M.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the virus causes lethal immunopathology are poorly understood. Here, we utilize multi-omics single-cell analysis to probe dynamic immune responses in patients with stable or progressive manifestations of COVID-19, and assess the effects of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. Coordinated profiling of gene expression and cell lineage protein markers reveals a prominent type-1 interferon response across all immune cells, especially in progressive patients. An anti-inflammatory innate immune response and a pre-exhaustion phenotype in activated T cells are hallmarks of progressive disease. Skewed T cell receptor repertoires in CD8 T cells and uniquely enriched V(D)J sequences are also identified in COVID-19 patients. B cell repertoire and somatic hypermutation analysis are consistent with a primary immune response, with possible contribution from memory B cells. Our in-depth immune profiling reveals dyssynchrony of the innate and adaptive immune interaction in progressive COVID-19, which may contribute to delayed virus clearance and has implications for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avraham Unterman","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tomokazu S.

In some regions such as the temperate northern hemisphere there are fears of \"second waves\" of infections over the coming months, while in other, vulnerable regions such as Africa and South America, concerns remain that cases may still rise, further impacting local economies and livelihoods. Despite substantial research efforts to date, it remains unresolved as to whether COVID-19 transmission has the same sensitivity to climate and seasonality observed for other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza. Here we investigate any empirical evidence of seasonality using a robust estimation framework. For 304 large cities across the world, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using logistic growth curves fitted to cumulative case data. We then assessed evidence for association with climatic variables through mixed-effects and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression while adjusting for city-level variation in demographic and disease control factors. We find evidence of association between temperature and R0 during the early phase of the epidemic in China only. During subsequent pandemic spread outside China, we instead find evidence of seasonal change in R0, with greater R0 within cities experiencing shorter daylight hours (direct effect coefficient = -0.247, p = 0.006), after separating out effects of calendar day. The effect of daylight hours may be driven by levels of UV radiation, which is known to have detrimental effects on coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In the global analysis excluding China, climatic variables had weaker explanatory power compared to demographic or disease control factors. Overall, we find a weak but detectable signal of climate variables on the transmission of COVID-19. As seasonal changes occur later in 2020, it is feasible that the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 may shift in a detectable manner. However, rates of transmission and health burden of the pandemic in the coming months will be ultimately determined by population factors and disease control policies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soeren Metelmann","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Karan Pattni","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Liam Brierley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Lisa Cavalerie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool \/ International Livestock Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cyril Caminade","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcus SC Blagrove","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Kieran J Sharkey","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baylis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cosme Jr.","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenxuan Deng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ming Chen","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Heatlh"},{"author_name":"Micha Sam Brickman Raredon","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Hoehn","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guilin Wang","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zuoheng Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Deiuliis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neal G.

Because it often occurs without any sign of rhinitis, lesions of the central olfactory system have been suspected. To date, however, there is no evidence that anosmia caused by SARS-CoV2 could be the result of brain damage. Methods: We conducted a case-series on 10 consecutive COVID-19 patients who reported anosmia. Each patient prospectively underwent a validated olfactory test (Sniffin Sticks test) and a brain MRI. Results: Hypersignal intensity lesions of the central olfactory system were found in 3 subjects on 3D T2 FLAIR and 2D T2 High Resolution images with a lesion involving the olfactory bulbs and\/or the orbitofrontal cortex. These 3 subjects showed a severe and persistent loss of smell on the olfactory test. Mucosal hyperplasia of the upper nasal cavities was found in two other subjects with significant smell disorders. There was no MRI anomaly in two subjects with good smell restoration. Conclusions: Anomalies of the central olfactory system could be responsible for anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to assess the impact on long-term functional prognosis of these lesions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yannick Girardeau","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Biostatistics and Public Health, AP-HP, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yoan GALLOIS","author_inst":"Service d Otologie, Otoneurologie et ORL pediatrique, Hopital Pierre-Paul Riquet, CHU Toulouse Purpan - Brain & Cognition Research Centre, UMR 5549, Universite "},{"author_name":"Guillaume DE BONNECAZE","author_inst":"Service d ORL et de chirurgie cervico-faciale, Hopital Larrey, CHU Toulouse, France"},{"author_name":"Bernard ESCUDE","author_inst":"Centre de Radiologie, Clinique Pasteur, Toulouse, France"},{"author_name":"Clarisse LAFONT","author_inst":"Centre de Radiologie, Clinique du Mont-Louis, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Gilles CHATELLIER","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Biostatistics and Public Health, AP-HP, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France - Universite de Paris, Faculte de Me"},{"author_name":"Mathieu MARX","author_inst":"Service d Otologie, Otoneurologie et ORL pediatrique, Hopital Pierre-Paul Riquet, CHU Toulouse Purpan - Service d ORL et de chirurgie cervico-faciale, Hopital L"},{"author_name":"Kieran J Sharkey","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baylis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cosme Jr.","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenxuan Deng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ming Chen","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Heatlh"},{"author_name":"Micha Sam Brickman Raredon","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Hoehn","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guilin Wang","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zuoheng Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Deiuliis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neal G.

In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by RdRp. We found that the incorporation efficiency of Remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and we did not observe chain termination or delayed chain termination caused by single Remdesivir-TP incorporation, while multiple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low either as ATP or GTP analogs, which suggested that mutagenesis may not be the mechanism of action of those two drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Incorporation of Sofosbuvir-TP is also very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2-C-Methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful in evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analog.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaofei Lu","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Weinan Zheng","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Jialei Sun","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Lan Hua","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Lan Xu","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Xin-jie Chu","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Sheng Ding","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Wen Xiong","author_inst":"Global Health Drug Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cosme Jr.","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenxuan Deng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ming Chen","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Heatlh"},{"author_name":"Micha Sam Brickman Raredon","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Hoehn","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guilin Wang","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zuoheng Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Deiuliis","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neal G.

To organise these models, we created a structure coverage map: a novel, one-stop visualization summarizing what is -- and is not -- known about the 3D structure of the viral proteome. The map highlights structural evidence for viral protein interactions, mimicry, and hijacking; it also helps researchers find 3D models of interest, which can then be mapped with UniProt, PredictProtein, or CATH features. The resulting Aquaria-COVID resource (https:\/\/aquaria.ws\/covid) helps scientists understand molecular mechanisms underlying coronavirus infection.

Such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity. Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs, and of the S protein, to investigate this  nicotinic hypothesis. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop of the S protein to three nAChRs, namely the human 4{beta}2 and 7 subtypes and the muscle-like {beta}{gamma}d receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results indicate that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs and the region responsible for binding contains the PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. In particular, R682 has a key role in the stabilisation of the complexes as it forms interactions with loops A, B and C in the receptors binding pocket. The conformational behaviour of the bound Y674-R685 region is highly dependent on the receptor subtype, adopting extended conformations in the 4{beta}2 and 7 complexes and more compact ones when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the 4{beta}2 and {beta}{gamma}d complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the 7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket where it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1 and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685 forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes. Analyses of the simulations of the full-length S protein show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding, and suggest a potential binding orientation of the S protein with nAChRs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Sofia Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Amaurys Avila Ibarra","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Isabel Bermudez","author_inst":"Oxford Brookes University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Casalino","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Zied Gaieb","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Deborah K Shoemark","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Timothy Gallagher","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Richard B Sessions","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Rommie E Amaro","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Adrian J Mulholland","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Mirjam Schilling","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Sofie E.

METHODS: All consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center were selected, including those treated with steroids and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients were allocated to the high doses (HD, 250mg\/day or more of methylprednisolone) of corticosteroids or the standard doses (SD, 1.5mg\/kg\/day or more of methylprednisolone) at discretion of treating physician. The primary endpoint was the mortality between both cohorts and secondary endpoints were the risk of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death and the risk of developing a severe ARDS. RESULTS: 573 patients were included: 428 (74.7%) men, with a median (IQR) age of 64 (54-73) years. In HD cohort, a worse baseline respiratory situation was observed and male sex, older age and comorbidities were significantly more common. After adjusting by baseline characteristics, HD were associated with a higher mortality than SD (adjusted-OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.58-3.83, p<0.001) and with an increased risk of needing MV or death (adjusted-OR 2.50, p=0.001). Conversely, the risk of developing a severe ARDS was similar between groups. Interaction analysis showed that HD increased mortality exclusively in elderly patients. CONCLUSION: Our real-world experience advises against exceeding 1-1.5mg\/kg\/day of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 with an ARDS, especially in older subjects. This reinforces the rationale of modulating rather than suppressing immune responses in these patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enric Monreal","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Susana Sainz de la Maza","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Elena Natera-Villalba","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Alvaro Beltran-Corbellini","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Fernando Rodriguez-Jorge","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Fernandez-Velasco","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Paulette Walo-Delgado","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Alfonso Muriel","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Javier Zamora","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Araceli Alonso-Canovas","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jesus Fortun","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Luis Manzano","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Beatriz Montero-Errasquin","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Lucienne Costa-Frossard","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jaime Masjuan","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Luisa Maria Villar","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Victoria H.

Short intensive training and reployment of non-specialists is an option but the effectiveness is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether there was difference in in-hospital mortality rates between COVID-19 patients managed by a mixed team (including non-specialists who had short intensive training and operated to a strict protocol) and those managed by a specialist team of health care workers. Design: Cohort study, from January 26, 2020 to April 7, 2020, follow up to April 7, 2020. Setting: Multicenter - Wuhan Hankou Hospital and Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, Wuhan, China. Participants: 261 HCWs deployed to Wuhan from Guangdong emergency rescue team and the 269 COVID-19 patients they treated. Exposure: Among 261 health care workers, 130 were in the specialist team and included 33 physicians, 32 of whom (97.0%) of whom were from relevant specialties. Each physician was in charge of 25-27 beds, with a 6-hour shift time. The mixed team included 131 health care workers, with 7 of the 28 physicians (25.0%) from relevant specialties. Each physician managed 12-13 beds, with a 4-hour shift time. Non-specialists received short-term intensive training and then followed strict management protocols. Specialists practiced as normal. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcome was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Another outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. Results: A total of 269 patients were included (144 male). In-hospital mortality rate of patients treated by the specialist teams and the mixed teams was 12.6% (20\/159) and 12.7% (14\/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97). None of the health care workers were infected. Conclusions and Relevance: Training and reployment of non-specialists is an effective solution for the shortage of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ming Kuang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yifeng Luo","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Han Xiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ruiming Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliate Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Shouzhen Cheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Sui Peng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"KarKeung Cheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Xiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Luis Manzano","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Beatriz Montero-Errasquin","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Lucienne Costa-Frossard","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jaime Masjuan","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Luisa Maria Villar","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Victoria H.

Exacerbating this problem was a shortage of diagnostic testing capability, resulting in a delay in time-to-result return. An improvement in diagnostic testing availability and timeliness was necessary to improve the allocation of resources and ultimate throughput of patients. The management of a COVID-19 positive patient or patient under investigation requires infection control measures that can quickly consume personal protective equipment (PPE) stores and personnel available to treat these patients. Critical shortages of both PPE and personnel also negatively impact care in patients admitted with non-COVID-19 illnesses. Methods: A multisectoral partnership of healthcare providers, facilities and academicians created a molecular diagnostic lab within an academic research facility dedicated to testing inpatients and healthcare personnel for SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of the laboratory was to provide a temporary solution to the East Baton Rouge Parish healthcare community until individual facilities were self-sustaining in testing capabilities. We describe the partnership and the impacts of this endeavor by developing a model derived from a combination of data sources, including electronic health records, hospital operations, and state and local resources. Findings: Our model demonstrates two important principles: the impact of reduced turnaround times (TAT) on potential differences in inpatient population numbers for COVID-19 and savings in PPE attributed to the more rapid TAT. Interpretation: Overall, we provide rationale for and demonstration of the utility of multisectoral partnerships when responding to public health emergencies.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca C Christofferson","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Hollis R O'Neal","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge"},{"author_name":"Tonya Jagneaux","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge"},{"author_name":"Catherine S O'Neal","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge"},{"author_name":"Christine S Walsh","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"E.

After nearly two months, the curve was successfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually relaxed. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions are not yet available so it is expected that preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, hence the need for well-informed models. In this study, we built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified-SEIRD model with detailed hospital dynamics. Because the hospitalization data for Belgium are not made publically available by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Sciensano), we computed the hospitalization parameters based on data from 370 patients treated in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. The basic reproduction number was estimated as R0 = 2.83 in March 2020 and the model fits the hospitalization and ICU admission incidence under lockdown measures well. Despite the relaxation of social restrictions, hospitalizations have been steadily declining. We recomputed the basic reproduction number under lockdown release and found that it had to be as low as R0 = 0.73 to explain the endemic trend. We further found that although the basic reproduction number in the population older than 70 years was smaller than one, this group compromises nearly half of the expected hospitalizations. This indicates that the protection of the elderly may be the most efficient way to reduce strain on the public health care system in case of another SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tijs W.

This study estimated nurses' influenza vaccine uptake and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined the corresponding psychological antecedents. Methods : A cross-sectional online survey among nurses was conducted during the main COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components (i.e., confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), work stress and COVID-related work demands (i.e., insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported. Results: The influenza vaccination coverage and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively, among 1205 eligible nurses. Influenza vaccine uptake was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs, whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility towards the vaccine. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. Conclusion: Vaccine uptake\/intention was well predicted by the 5C constructs. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, communities are not ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kin Kit Li","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok Hung Tang","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Samuel Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shui Shan Lee","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Luan V Dinh","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Abigail I Fish","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Anh Phan","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Thaya E Stoufflet","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Schroeder","author_inst":"Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Morgan K Walker","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge"},{"author_name":"Erik A Turner","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Christi G Pierce","author_inst":"Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"K.

Here we show that aggregated cultural values of nations, derived from World Values Survey data, have been at least as important as top-down government actions in predicting the impact of COVID-19. Whereas trust in institutions predicts lower COVID-19 deaths per capita, secular- rationalism and cosmopolitanism each predict more deaths. The effects of these cultural values register more strongly than government efficiency. This suggests that open democracies may face greater challenges in limiting a pandemic, and that all nations should consider their cultural values as actionable parameters in their future preparations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Damian J Ruck","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Joshua Borycz","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"R.

An online survey was conducted with 11,333 people (52.4% women; mean age = 46.3 {+\/-} 14.6 years, range = 18-89 years) during the mild lockdown in the seven prefectures most affected by COVID-19 infection. Over one-third (36.6%) of participants experienced mild-to-moderate psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K6] score 5-12), while 11.5% reported serious psychological distress (K6 score [&ge;] 13). The estimated prevalence of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score [&ge;] 10) was 17.9%. Regarding the distribution of K6 scores, the proportion of individuals displaying psychological distress in this study was significantly higher compared to previous national survey data from 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019. Healthcare workers, those with a history of treatment for mental illness, and younger participants (aged 18-19 or 20-39 years) were particularly vulnerable. Psychological distress severity was influenced by specific interactional structures of risk factors: high loneliness, poor interpersonal relationships, COVID-19-related sleeplessness and anxiety, deterioration of household economy, and work and academic difficulties. Flexible approaches that are optimised for the difficulties specific to each individual through cross-disciplinary public-private initiatives are important to combat lockdown-induced mental health problems.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tetsuya Yamamoto","author_inst":"Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Chigusa Uchiumi","author_inst":"Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Naho Suzuki","author_inst":"Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Junichiro Yoshimoto","author_inst":"Nara Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Eric Murillo-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Universidad Anahuac Mayab"},{"author_name":"Shui Shan Lee","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Luan V Dinh","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Abigail I Fish","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Anh Phan","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Thaya E Stoufflet","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R Schroeder","author_inst":"Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Morgan K Walker","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Baton Rouge"},{"author_name":"Erik A Turner","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Christi G Pierce","author_inst":"Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center"},{"author_name":"K.
